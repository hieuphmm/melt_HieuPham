Welcome to MELT documentations!
================================

**MELT** is a framework for refining and deploying Vietnamese language models, built on the Hugging Face Transformers library. It provides tools for fine-tuning, evaluating, and deploying models, with a flexible design that allows for easy expansion with new models and datasets.

See our `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02715/>`_ for more information.

The code is hosted on GitHub here.
