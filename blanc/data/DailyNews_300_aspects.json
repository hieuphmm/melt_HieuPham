These inequalities were less stark and visible until the 1980s. They have acquired an intimidating and entrenched disposition over the last two decades. \n \nWhat are the factors that explain this amplification in disparities? This article attempts to identify these and expose the state capture by the elites employing a distorted, biased framework of laws and regulations: \n \na) The rising share and pace of expansion of the capital and skill-intensive sectors of the economy, like finance, IT, telecommunication, energy and oil and gas, in which the less privileged sections of the population cannot participate meaningfully because the state did not provide them equal opportunity through quality education. \n \nb) Policies that have promoted or reinforced crony capitalism through the provision of artificial crutches, to protect some industrial enterprises from competition (under the legislative cover of the much-maligned SROs). Moreover, the state has not only turned a blind eye to the hoarding and formation of cartels it has also backed off when facing resistance to the widening of the tax net by some groups like small traders. \n  \nThe state has become a hostage to the perceptions of interest groups on how our political, bureaucratic and economic formations should be organised. \n  \nc) The institution of an unfair tax structure which has treated the same levels of incomes from different sources differently, reflected in light taxation (eg of capital gains in real estate and equities and a host of other commercial activities and sectors) and tax exemptions (eg the IPPs and the agriculture sector\u2014 in the latter case supplemented by subsidies on inputs like fertiliser, irrigation water and electricity for tube wells and support prices for wheat and sugar cane at higher than international prices). \n \nd) Perks and privileges like free or heavily subsidised plots in key urban centres to state functionaries and similar handouts to allies by the political leadership. A rapidly growing population, complemented by the real estate sector serving as a haven for parking black money, the prices of these plots prices rose exponentially, aided by the continuing legality of benami-held property. \n \ne) The non-transparent use of discretionary powers and authority with impunity by the political leadership whereby lavish gifts\u2019 of \u2018contracts and regulatory concessions\u2019 (eg relaxation of building and zoning regulations) have been bestowed upon friends and supporters. By becoming direct or indirect (through payoffs) stakeholders in real estate development the political and bureaucratic elites have made untaxed fortunes. \n \nf) The entry of a powerful lobby of commission agents and deal fixers of transactions involving public-sector corporations and agencies bred further corruption. \n \ne) Some economic actors, allegedly abetted by public servants, acquired affluence from illegal/ criminal activities (trade in drugs, arms and ammunition, smuggling, misdeclaration of prices of imports and exports and the \u2018hundi\u2019 market for foreign currency, etc). \n \nf) Rampant tax evasion of the resulting incomes and the protection of dysfunctional and tainted administrative systems reinforced the inequalities in favour of the segments of society mentioned. \n \nThe dominant ethos of policy favours and abuse of powers have triggered the creation of a political, social and cultural value system rooted in paternalistic and personal relations, nepotism and patronage and violation of laws. The state has become a hostage to the perceptions of these interest groups on how Pakistan\u2019s political, bureaucratic and economic formations should be organised, resulting in venality and the misuse of powers becoming institutionalised, leading to further imbalance in income and asset distribution. \n \nTo grasp the nature and scale of inequalities, the following data would be instructive: i) whereas the ratio in shares of incomes of the top 20 per cent and bottom 20pc households was roughly five to one in 2000 it had risen to beyond eight by 2015-16; ii) While this ratio was, say, eight, the ratio of tax incidence between the two groups was below two, reflecting the regressive nature of the tax regime that has been pursued and greater reliance on indirect taxes for revenue generation; iii) the cheapest imported luxury car costs 20 years\u2019 income of a household in the bottom 20pc! \n \nThese growing disparities have manifested themselves in the imports of luxury cars (and the resulting imports of parts and more petrol), designer clothes, expensive mobile phones, generators for domestic use, solar panels and food items, foreign exchange for financing foreign education and travel abroad for recreational purposes and deluxe-style pilgrimages. \n \nThe constitution and quality of economic growth as reflected in the items (goods and services) imported for consumption or to feed domestic production configurations has determined the composition and size of the economy and consumption patterns, and thereby the industrial structure, the production technology and the level and skill mix of employment. The free play of market forces has reinforced the inequalities. \n \nMeanwhile, cheap external inflows (because of fortuitous international events at various times) have managed to keep the state afloat. This has enabled postponement of basic reforms, with short-sighted elites happy with the augmentation of their personal fortunes derived from the implementation of such a strategy, while the rest of the country continued to operate below potential. \n \nTo conclude, the emerging sectors of the economy and discriminatory state policies and actions that favoured certain interest groups and classes have exacerbated income disparities. And its worsening has not only been the key determinant of the outcome on the external front but has also exposed the sustainability of the prevailing model and pattern of growth. \n \nThe soft options of the past (concessional aid, remittances, bounties that became available from events like the Cold War, the Afghan war, 9/11etc;) that enabled the elite to postpone fundamental restructuring of this crumbling state and associated political-economic ties, are not likely to be available in such abundance in future. Therefore, addressing the economic issues stemming from the consumption demands of those with large disposable incomes will eventually require basic, structural reforms to remove the constraints to a more equitable and sustainable growth path. \n \nThe writer is a former governor of the State Bank. \n \nPublished in Dawn, October 7th, 2\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [5, 14, 21, 19, 13, 12, 23, 6, 4], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 21, 19, 12, 4, 23, 13, 6], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [13, 23, 6, 12, 4, 5, 14, 19, 21, 15, 15], "scores": [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [21, 13, 4, 19, 14, 5, 6, 23, 12], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [12, 23, 6, 15, 15, 5, 13, 21, 14, 19, 4], "scores": [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Five members of the Bengali community , including two of a family , were picked up and killed by Ulfa ( I ) rebels on Thursday night.\nTrinamul Congress leaders from West Bengal visited the aggrieved families on the instructions of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.\nThey vowed to strengthen their voice in brining the perpetrators of the crime to book.\nThe delegation also gave Rs 1 lakh to each of the families as compensation from the chief minister.\nThe killing took place in the Tinsukia district of Upper Assam , India , after the publication of National Register of Citizens.", "text": "The members of the delegation also gave Rs 1 lakh to each of the families as compensation from the West Bengal chief minister. \n \nGuwahati: Amid simmering tension after the killing of five Bengali youths, a team of Trinamul Congress leaders from West Bengal visited the families of those massacred by the outlawed Ulfa(I) rebels in Assam and vowed to strengthen their voice in brining the perpetrators of the crime to book. \n \nThe delegation comprising Rajya Sabha MPs Derek O\u2019Brien and Nadimul Haq, Lok Sabha MP Mamata Bala Thakur and MLA Mahua Moitra told reporters that they visited the aggrieved families on the instructions of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who has expressed anguish over the killing and said an environment of violence was prevailing all across the country. \n \nFive members of the Bengali community, including two of a family, were picked up and killed by Ulfa(I) rebels on Thursday night in Upper Assam\u2019s Tinsukia district. \n \nThe members of the delegation also gave `1 lakh to each of the families as compensation from the West Bengal chief minister. \u201cWe\u2019re with you.

According to Karachi Chamber of Commerce  and  Industry (KCCI), through an amendment to Section 8 (Sub-Sec.1, Clause M) of Sales Tax Act 1990, it is now mandatory for the supplier of goods to provide CNIC number of unregistered buyer of raw materials and finished products, effectively placing the responsibility to identify non-filers on the shoulders of compliant taxpayers. It was pointed out that with a dismally narrow tax base of Sales Tax registered persons comprising hardly 35000 in number, it is virtually impossible for the importers, manufacturers and suppliers of goods to find registered buyers or those willing to provide their CNIC details. Consequently the inventories of unsold goods with traders, stockists, importers and manufacturers are piling up, blocking their entire working capital as well as the funds borrowed from banks.

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" \n \nThis was passed in the wake of the Civil War, to ensure that slaves born in the United States were granted full citizenship, no matter the state laws. \n \nThat's also one reason the 14th Amendment has been a perennial obsession of white nationalists and right-wing militia groups, such as the sovereign citizen movement. \n \nBut rarely if ever has this wingnut argument made its way to the Oval Office. \n \nPlay to the base prejudice aside, the President cannot undo the Constitution. That's basic separation of powers stuff. \n \nThe President told Axios -- which seemed tipped off to ask the question by the White House in advance of the launch of its HBO special series -- that unnamed advisers had told him he could overturn birthright citizenship through the legislature or by executive order. \n \nThis is BS. No adviser with a passing understanding of the US government would seriously suggest this. Far more likely is that Trump was floating a trial balloon to change the national conversation and inflame the base. \n \nBut this trial balloon is particularly ironic given the conservative movement's obsession with Obama-era executive orders, which it loudly argued marked an assault on the Constitution, calling him \"King Obama\" -- and much worse. In contrast, they claimed to be \"constitutional conservatives\" -- faithful to the vision of the Founding Fathers. \n \nThere's nothing particularly wrong with executive orders -- George Washington and Thomas Jefferson used them and they ballooned under Republicans Ulysses S. Grant and Teddy Roosevelt. In fact, Barack Obama used fewer executive orders than his predecessors George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan -- though you'd never know it from watching Fox News during the last presidency. And then there's this: Trump is on pace to exceed the number of Obama executive orders if he serves two terms. (Obama issued an average of 35 executive orders a year. If Trump were to issue no more executive orders this year, his average would be 43 per year.) \n \nBut having raised the issue as a threat to the Constitution, it is absurd that Republicans are now ignoring or even encouraging the action because a president of their party is in power. Even more absurd is the fact that Trump has been issuing executive orders while Republicans have unified control of government. Such orders are most rationally used to overcome an obstructive opposition in Congress. \n \nAnother fundamental Trump mis-truth is the idea that birthright citizenship is unique to the United States. It's not. Canada and Mexico, and more than two dozen other countries, have similar statutes. \n \nVice President Mike Pence tried to support Trump when he said Tuesday, \"We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether or not the language of the 14th Amendment, 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally.\" \n \nBut Republican Rep. Justin Amash was right when he tweeted , \"A president cannot amend Constitution or laws via executive order. Concept of natural-born citizen in #14thAmendment derives from natural-born subject in Britain. Phrase 'and subject to the jurisdiction thereof' excludes mainly foreign diplomats, who are not subject to U.S. laws.\" \n \nSen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, made the point bipartisan: \"This notion that he can simply violate the Constitution by executive order, let's face it, no serious legal scholar thinks that's real.\" \n \nAs we've seen, some Trump defenders will point to \"anchor baby tourism\" as a problem in need of a solution. There are indeed properties that cater to this abuse of birthright citizenship. Trump should know -- his own Trump-branded properties in Florida are often advertised by third parties to expectant Russian parents, as The Daily Beast reported back in 2017 when I was editor-in-chief. Physician, heal thyself. And the President can start by cracking down on the practice through law enforcement rather than threatening to ignore the Constitution. \n \nBut just because the President can't unilaterally override the Constitution doesn't mean he won't try. He could sign an executive order, possibly against the legal advice of his Justice Department and immediately have the proposal blocked by suits from several states attorneys general. Because this isn't a jump ball, the issue will fail on the merits when it reaches the courts. \n \nBy then the President may have milked this for political benefit. So make no mistake -- this is play-to-the-base panic, a classic Trump attempt to distract and deflect.

I clearly remember how experts never thought the FTSE 100 would break the 7,000 mark, but I can\u2019t recall which hole in the ground my savings fell into. I even spent 18 months working in New York and wracked up hundreds of pounds in bank charges because I didn\u2019t get one of those\u2026 foreign currency card thingys.\n\nAnd if I\u2019ve been a bit, shall we say, lax, with my cash, then I imagine many others are in the same boat? After all, most of us didn\u2019t get financial education at school, and I think a lesson on pensions or how to send an invoice would have been more useful than weekly experiments in Home Economics about how much baking soda can ruin a brownie.In my defence, it\u2019s tempting to be apathetic in a world where most of the \u201cbenefits\u201d of products like pensions and ISAs benefit the truly rich. Getting on the property ladder is almost impossible \u2013 most of us need our parents to help out. The cycle of poverty is real, and money only makes more money if you have it in the first place.My third excuse is that money, for some unfathomable reason, is put in the same category as rocket science \u2013 technical, detailed, irrelevant \u2013 or it\u2019s seen as an imminent disaster, with American pundits screaming on cable news about the latest hot stock or announcement by the central bank. We put money experts on a pedestal and worship them \u2013 and that didn\u2019t turn out so well for former fund manager star Neil Woodford. But money is not an exclusive club. For example, we don\u2019t need to be up to speed on the ramifications of every by-election to take an interest in politics. We also don\u2019t need to know the direction of equity markets (they normally go up over the long term anyway) or know the interest rate of a government bond to sort out our finances. So, the million-dollar question: how can I get better with my money? One is learning, and talking to other people about their finances. Taking small steps at a time. Deciding what I really want and focusing on my goals, rather than saving for a future I don\u2019t know is going to happen. (Despite women\u2019s mags advising me to the contrary, I refuse to give up my takeaway coffee most days \u2013 I get a discount with my KeepCup.) I\u2019ve taken some simple steps over the last year instead: consolidate my pensions into one pot; invest in premium bonds; open a stocks and shares ISA; put aside 30 per cent of my income to pay tax and student loan, and cut down on what I spend i.e. subscriptions and fast fashion.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent eventsThere is a higher purpose here, I like to think. In the UK, there is a very significant gender pay gap (8.6 per cent for full-time workers), a gender pension gap (almost 40 per cent in 2017/18) and a gender investment gap, (YouGov research shows that 52 per cent of women have never put their money into an investment product, compared to 37 per cent of men). And while what we really need is to change the overarching structures that affect those gaps i.e. corporate transparency and legislation \u2013 in the meantime we can at least gain confidence in our own money matters.And we should gain confidence, because research shows that women make good, if not better, investors compared to men. Women are more risk averse, and less emotional. As someone who has interviewed the man who brought down Barings Bank in the 1990s through excessive risk taking, I believe this to be true.\n\nIn other words, I want to shake that magic money tree.

Murthy, also famous as Gitam Murthy and Gold Spot Murthy for successfully marketing the soft drink of that brand, was in the US to address an alumni meeting of the university he founded. \n\nMurthy and three others died when they were on their way from Alaska to visit Anchorage wildlife sanctuary. \n\nOthers who died in the accident include V Basavapunnaiah, V Shivaprasad and VBR Choudhary. \n\nTelugu Association of North America president Satish Vemana said all the four bodies were shifted to Alaska State Medical Examination Centre for post mortem. Another person who was injured in the accident was also admitted to hospital. \n\nThe news of his death sent shock waves in Visakhapatnam from where he was elected to Lok Sabha twice in 1991 and 1999. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu expressed grief and distress over the death of the senior party leader and directed the state government officials based in New Delhi to make necessary arrangements to bring the body of Murthy for funeral with state honours. Murthy was with the TDP since its formation by the film star turned politician NT Rama Rao. \n\nA successful businessman, he turned to education when he founded Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management and worked hard to take it to new heights.

These companies are of US origin. However, they conduct their businesses globally and therefore earn significant revenue from markets abroad. \n \nUS Tech companies prefer keeping their foreign revenue in offshore tax havens for obvious reasons. America is known for its high tax rates. \n \nTech companies have to distribute dividends. Some of those companies roll out \u201cshare buyback\u201d schemes. Others have different types of financial commitments to meet. Executing these activities requires Billions of US Dollars. From an investors\u2019 point of view, a question that arises is how exactly these companies meet their financial obligations in the US while their funds are parked outside of the US. \n \nThe financial industry facilitates these tech companies to meet their financial obligations. The common man is however not aware of the financial wizardry involved. \n \nTech companies over the years issued corporate bonds in the American debt market to meet their financing needs. The interest amount paid/to be paid on account of sales of these bonds was less as compared to tax liability on funds parked abroad, if they ever were repatriated. Over the period of time, these tech companies became \u201clarge corporate bond sellers\u201d. Bloomberg named them \u201cnon-financial borrowers\u201d. \n \nBusiness Insider (UK) reported in April 2018 that \u201cApple has the largest cash pile ($261 billion) amongst US companies\u201d. It further said that \u201ca large chunk of that cash pile is stashed overseas (out of the USA)\u201d. As per Bloomberg (31 August, 2018), Apple has accumulated corporate debt of more than $150 billion. \n \nRather than focusing on any specific company, let\u2019s study the overall impact of these tech companies on the US economy. \n \nBefore Trump administration, tech companies were continuing with their strategy of corporate bond sales and were piling up US debt market to meet their cash flow requirements (e.g. acquisitions, share buybacks, shareholder payouts etc.). The recent tax overhaul, made by Trump administration incentivised these Tech companies to repatriate their funds to USA. \n \nBloomberg reports (on 31 August, 2018) that after the revision of tax regulations, tech companies have repatriated $306 billion from abroad. \u201cStrategas Securities\u201d, a US based brokerage and advisory firm estimates that the total amount could reach\u00a0 $700 billion by end of the year (2018). \n \nImpact of Repatriation \n \nWith funds in hand, most of the tech giants intend to \u201cbuyback\u201d their shares. For an existing shareholder, the share buyback is like a dividend payout, albeit more attractive. The companies benefit from it because decreased supply of its shares in the equity market raises its share price, a simple application of demand and supply theory. \n \nThe following example makes it simple to understand the financial benefit of \u201cshare buyback\u201d. (Please note that rates and amounts given are for example purposes). \n \nFunds repatriated from abroad, if invested in Treasury bills \u2013\u00a0 $100 @ 2% equals to $2. \n \nPayout to shareholders who hold shares worth the $100 @ 10% equals to $10 \n \nThe resulting economic value is \u201cnegative\u201d ($8). \n \nTherefore, if $100 worth of shares are \u201cbought back\u201d from shareholders, it will result in significant savings. \n \nIt is very easy to comprehend that repatriated excess funds, if utilised for \u201cshare buyback\u201d, will save money for these tech giants long term. Hoarding cash now is not wise. In fact, the savings can be utilised to pay corporate debt liabilities as and when they become due. \n \nUS corporate debt market was significantly influenced by these \u201cnon-financial borrowers\u201d. In coming years it will see a significant decline in sales of corporate bonds. The economic pundits are working on different probable outcomes that might result due to sudden cash influx caused by tech giants. By end of this year, actual position will surface out and future direction of the US corporate debt market will be set."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 13, 4, 19, 12, 5, 14, 21], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [13, 12, 6, 23, 4, 5, 19, 14, 21], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 21, 14, 12, 5, 4, 13, 19, 23], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [23, 5, 21, 12, 6, 13, 14, 4, 19], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 23, 4, 13, 12, 21, 5, 14, 6, 15, 19], "scores": [0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Young members of the Matigsalug tribe of Davao City can now learn more about their language and culture.\nThe app has interactive features teaching users how to pronounce letters properly and how to write the alphabet through tracing.\nIt also lets users sing along to the songs of children.\nThe project is part of Smart ' s efforts to digitize educational content in local languages.\nIt has already launched literacy apps in Cebuano and Arabic.\nIt is currently working on a similar app for Kapampangan , Waray , Chavacano , and the Blaan and Tagakaulo indigenous peoples.", "text": "Young members of the Matigsalug tribe can now learn more about their language and culture through an app developed in partnership with Smart.

Nathaniel Chalobah did the same. The latter will miss out on a return to Stamford Bridge with Watford on Saturday due to injury but he can feel vindicated nevertheless having already made five times as many starts for the Hornets as he made for Chelsea. \n\nCoincidentally, Chalobah, like Solanke, could well have featured more regularly had he stayed given Chelsea's recent injury crisis. N'Golo Kante and Danny Drinkwater are missing in midfield, while first-choice striker Alvaro Morata has only just returned following a hamstring problem. Conte has been open about his frustrations. \n\nChelsea vs Watford \n\nOctober 21, 2017, 11:30am \n\nLive on \n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \n\n\"The situation is difficult,\" he said in midweek. \"We have to play every three days and it is not simple. Also because, in this moment, we are thin we have to play always the same players.\" Summer target Radja Nainggolan lined up for opponents Roma on Wednesday and the Chelsea boss clearly wishes the club had added more depth to the squad in the summer. \n\nAnd yet, there remains an alternative. The option is there to trust in the talents of the country's most successful academy of the past decade. To give the gifted young players at Stamford Bridge the chance to play some Premier League football. Musonda will be waiting to see that team sheet against Watford.

That's what he did by developing 3D-printed bandages. For more information see the IDTechEx report on 3D printing materials .  \nGerstenhaber, a bioengineering professor, along with the help of other engineering faculty and students, created a 3D printer that uses electrospinning technology to print bandages directly onto a patient's skin, making them fit the individual's physical form. \n \nElectrospinning technology is a production method used to make polymer fiber, which is a synthetic material. \n \nOn March 25, Gerstenhaber presented a demonstration of the prototype \u2014 which consists of a larger robotic piece made from additional 3D-printed components \u2014 at The Franklin Institute. \n \nGerstenhaber drew inspiration from a presentation made by Peter Lelkes, the bioengineering department chair, while he was pursuing his Ph.D. in bioengineering at Temple last year. He said Lelkes' work focused on bone regeneration using fabrics made from cytosine, one of the bases found in DNA. \n \n\"What he found was that suddenly he had an ability to lay these fabrics on holes drilled in skulls of mice, and they could heal them,\" Gerstenhaber said. \"(The holes were) big enough that they wouldn't (normally) heal on a mouse.\" \n  \nWhen Gerstenhaber saw the presentation, he started to think about individualizing dental and jaw implants, many of which are standardized. \n \n\"All of their implants were either flat, or perfectly round, something they could do without having a complicated robot do it for them because they were limited,\" Gerstenhaber said. \"(Prosthetic companies) couldn't make any realistic examples of any of these use scenarios because the tools didn't exist.\" \n \n\u00a0 \n \nBranching off from Lelkes' project, Gerstenhaber wanted to develop a flexible bandage for serious wounds that would not only stop bleeding, but also quickly regenerate the skin. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\"I was like, 'Wow, I'm making this tool to make my life easier, but it's going to open this whole new avenue of research,'\" Gerstenhaber said. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nHis bandages are made with a soy protein, which helps tissue heal faster than it would if covered by a conventional bandage. The technique is being researched in labs within the College of Engineering. The participating scientists are testing the bandages to ensure they have the capability of helping external tissue regenerate. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWhen applied with water, the white bandages adhere to the skin in an almost invisible fashion. Then, when the patient moves, the bandage moves with them, almost as though it were part of their skin. \n \n\u00a0 \n  \n\"We've mainly been looking at burns, and the sorts of wounds that don't heal well, and when they heal, they sort of heal like very bad skin,\" Gerstenhaber said. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSome other bioengineering professors, as well as undergraduate and graduate students, have contributed to the project under the supervision of Lelkes and bioengineering professor Yah-el Har-el. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nBaran Arig, a sophomore bioengineering major, started working on the bandage project as a freshman. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nArig, who conducted research on electrospinning in high school, said he wanted to continue his study of the technology. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\"For the most part, what I am doing is I am making a viscous solution for the electrospinner,\" Arig said. \"I am spinning these solutions to create these electrospun scaffolds that can be looked at through a microscope.\" \n \n\u00a0 \n \nIn addition to the main printing prototype, Gerstenhaber and his colleagues have also constructed a modified, handheld version of the 3D printer.

The famed front-of-house engineer has a point: That resume is packed with work for such hallowed acts as Aerosmith, Whitesnake, the Cult, Foreigner, Creedence Clearwater Revival, along supergroups like Velvet Revolver and Kings of Chaos. (Boldface names along the lines of Lady Gaga and Enrique Iglesias fill up the rest.) Working with that kind of talent is one of the perks of being one of the best in the FOH business. \n \nBut like many, Kimball\u2019s original plan was to be one of those rock & roll stars himself. \u201cI was a musician first,\u201d he says, \u201cbut just by having to be my own sound guy, I started to fall in love by twisting knobs. At some point, I realized I couldn\u2019t really make a living and support my family by playing in a band\u2014but I realized I could do that by doing sound for bands. So I just bounced over, and one band just kind of led to another.\u201d \n \nThis summer, that path has led to a gig with Tears for Fears, who are on an arena tour co-headlining with another pair of \u201980s superstars, Hall & Oates. It\u2019s not Kimball\u2019s first go-round with the British pop-rock icons. \u201cI\u2019ve been working with Tears for Fears for years,\u201d he says, \u201cand the main reason is that I just really love their music. For a sound guy, it\u2019s really rare to be working with a band like that. With them, it\u2019s like mixing a record in a studio every day. These guys are just phenomenal\u2014and they\u2019re great human beings on top of that.\u201d \n \nGiven his status in the FOH universe, Kimball could probably get his hands on any piece of gear he wants. But when he recently was in the market for a preamp, he made the decision to incorporate Focusrite\u2019s ISA 828 eight-channel microphone preamp into his arsenal. \u201cI was searching around for preamps,\u201d he says \u201csomething I could use in a rack setup. I was looking at Neve, but the cost and the fact that they weren\u2019t built in a rack style meant that wasn\u2019t ideal; I didn\u2019t want to be physically stacking those boxes all the time. Then I came across the 828, saw that it had eight channels of Focusrite pres in a 2U rack space, and said, \u2018Okay, let me check this out.\u2019\u201d \n \nNeedless to say, Kimball liked what he found, and quickly added the ISA 828 to his set-up. \u201cI thought it would be a good idea to incorporate a splitter, set it up so that everything went into the 828s first, and then slid out to both monitors and front of house,\u201d he explains \u201cThat way, we were all getting the preamp sound. And we can get the best of both worlds\u2014we get analog on the front end, and then we can still have the conveniences of the digital world, with recall and all that. I\u2019ll tell you, when we started rehearsals, my jaw was on the ground, like \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of this a long time ago?\u201d The monitor guy, who\u2019s been working with Tears for Fears for four years himself, was the same: \u2018Why didn\u2019t we do this years ago?\u2019\u201d \n \nA major factor leading to Kimball\u2019s adoption of the ISA 828 was the preamp\u2019s tonal quality. Befitting his love for classic sounds, he fell in love with the luxurious richness that the unit offers\u2014which, as it happens, is based on a design created by Rupert Neve in 1985 for Sir George Martin\u2019s AIR Studios. \u201cThe 828 just warmed everything up, and gave me tones I hadn\u2019t heard for years, bringing in those second and third harmonic tones,\u201d he says. \u201cSpecifically with Tears for Fears, the bass tone had always been a bit thin and clanky. So what I tried was to bring in a diaphragm microphone to replace what we had been using, then put the Focusrite pres on both channels\u2014and it completely changed the sound of that bass. It sounded so warm. I thought, there it is! That\u2019s the sound I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d \n \nThat attention to sound quality is what makes Kimball one of the most in-demand FOH engineers around\u2014but what really keeps him going is the thrill of the show itself. \u201cThe studio thing doesn\u2019t float my boat,\u201d he admits. You can be sitting there all day working on a kick drum. \u201cWhat I like is the adrenaline of a live show, when the house is dark and things are about to start and you\u2019re thinking, okay\u2014time to make it happen.

The Peanut Van was processing twenty two flavours on the same line. \n \nTo prevent cross-contamination of allergens contained within the ingredients, the machinery had to be washed down on a relatively frequent basis. \n \nThe problem was that it took three people twelve hours to dissemble the machinery and wash it down. \u201cWe had to resolve the problems or get out of business,\u201d Patch says. \n \nSo The Peanut Van decided to go out to the marketplace to seek a solution and settled on DiverseCo company AccuPak, a systems integrator of dosing/weighing, packaging, palletising equipment and product inspection systems, to come up with the answers. \n \nTo kick things off, an AccuPak business analyst and engineer reviewed The Peanut Van\u2019s production facilities, processes and packaging line requirement. \n \nThe company then set about to design a robust, reliable and flexible turnkey solution that would enable The Peanut Van to acquire new operational capabilities and set new benchmarks. \n \nRead the rest of this article >>\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [12, 5, 21, 14, 6, 4, 23, 19, 13], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [12, 15, 19, 4, 14, 5, 21, 15, 6, 23, 13], "scores": [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [14, 13, 6, 12, 5, 21, 23, 4, 19], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 14, 12, 5, 21, 4, 13, 19, 23], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [4, 23, 15, 19, 13, 12, 6, 21, 5, 14], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Residents in Oak Grove , Illinois , are trying to stay as warm as possible.\nWhen using any form of gas heating source , homeowners should install a carbon monoxide alarm.\nCarbon monoxide is the \" invisible killer \" because it is odorless , colorless and no one can tell if it has permeated the home until it ' s too late.\nResidents should not use fuel - burning space heaters in a confined space.\nFor anyone that does have a fireplace , they should get their chimneys cleaned and checked.\nFire Chief Bill Johnson says people should not put flammable near heating sources.", "text": "As the community starts to experience colder temperatures, residents are trying to stay as warm as possible.

He added that people should not use fuel-burning space heaters in a confined space and encouraged everyone to use them outdoors rather than inside. \n\nWhile you might want to keep your home warm even while your away, it's advised to turn off all heating sources, excluding the home's heating system. \n\nsee fire/page a6 \n\nJohnson said, when trying to keep warm using a fireplace, it's important to make sure everything is working properly and appropriately contained. \n\n\"(For anyone that does have a fireplace), they definitely want get their chimneys cleaned and checked to make sure there's no cracks or leaks,\" he said. \n\n\"If they have a gas fireplace, make sure the connections are leak free and the equipment is working properly. If it's a wood burning one, make sure they have screens to stop sparks from flying into the room.\" \n\nWhen using any form of gas heating source, homeowners should install a carbon monoxide alarm. An increased amount of carbon monoxide can accumulate in the home, posing a serious threat to anyone inside. \n\nJohnson refers to carbon monoxide as the \"invisible killer\" because it is odorless, colorless and no one can tell if it has permeated the home until it's too late. \n\nAnother tip is to frequently check fire alarms and smoke detectors to be sure both are working properly. \n\nJohnson also emphasized to make sure heating sources are not easily accessible to children. \n \n\"Some people will use their oven to try and heat their home, especially if they don't have portable space heaters or their main heat system does not work efficiently,\" he said, \"but you should never use your stove or oven as a heat source.\" \n\nAdditional tips from the Nation Fire Protection Association are: \n\n\u2022 Have a qualified service professional annually inspect heating systems, especially in the months prior to temperatures dropping. \n\n\u2022 Never use a space heater or any other heating appliance with a damaged cord. \n\n\u2022 Never plug space heaters into an extension cord \n\n\u2022 Place space heaters only on level, flat services \n\n\u2022 Never leave them unattended. \n\n\u2022 Turn them off when leaving the room, home or sleeping.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [13, 14, 15, 4, 21, 19, 5, 12, 6, 23], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [13, 12, 23, 19, 4, 6, 14, 5, 15, 21], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 14, 5, 13, 21, 19, 4, 23, 12], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [4, 21, 15, 19, 13, 15, 14, 5, 6, 12, 23], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 5, 6, 13, 14, 21, 4, 19, 12, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "The widening inequality of incomes and wealth provides a more coherent explanation of the large current account deficits.\nThe state has not only turned a blind eye to the hoarding and formation of cartels.\nIt has also backed off when facing resistance to the widening of the tax net by some groups like small traders.\nIt has become a hostage to the perceptions of interest groups on how our political , bureaucratic and economic formations should be organised.\nSome economic actors , allegedly abetted by public servants , acquired affluence from illegal / criminal activities ( trade in drugs , arms and ammunition , criminal activities.", "text": "IN an earlier article, this writer had argued that the widening inequality of incomes and wealth provides a more coherent explanation of the structural character of the large current account deficits, as indicated by the increased concentration of certain categories of imports. These inequalities were less stark and visible until the 1980s. They have acquired an intimidating and entrenched disposition over the last two decades. \n \nWhat are the factors that explain this amplification in disparities? This article attempts to identify these and expose the state capture by the elites employing a distorted, biased framework of laws and regulations: \n \na) The rising share and pace of expansion of the capital and skill-intensive sectors of the economy, like finance, IT, telecommunication, energy and oil and gas, in which the less privileged sections of the population cannot participate meaningfully because the state did not provide them equal opportunity through quality education. \n \nb) Policies that have promoted or reinforced crony capitalism through the provision of artificial crutches, to protect some industrial enterprises from competition (under the legislative cover of the much-maligned SROs). Moreover, the state has not only turned a blind eye to the hoarding and formation of cartels it has also backed off when facing resistance to the widening of the tax net by some groups like small traders. \n  \nThe state has become a hostage to the perceptions of interest groups on how our political, bureaucratic and economic formations should be organised. \n  \nc) The institution of an unfair tax structure which has treated the same levels of incomes from different sources differently, reflected in light taxation (eg of capital gains in real estate and equities and a host of other commercial activities and sectors) and tax exemptions (eg the IPPs and the agriculture sector\u2014 in the latter case supplemented by subsidies on inputs like fertiliser, irrigation water and electricity for tube wells and support prices for wheat and sugar cane at higher than international prices). \n \nd) Perks and privileges like free or heavily subsidised plots in key urban centres to state functionaries and similar handouts to allies by the political leadership. A rapidly growing population, complemented by the real estate sector serving as a haven for parking black money, the prices of these plots prices rose exponentially, aided by the continuing legality of benami-held property. \n \ne) The non-transparent use of discretionary powers and authority with impunity by the political leadership whereby lavish gifts\u2019 of \u2018contracts and regulatory concessions\u2019 (eg relaxation of building and zoning regulations) have been bestowed upon friends and supporters. By becoming direct or indirect (through payoffs) stakeholders in real estate development the political and bureaucratic elites have made untaxed fortunes. \n \nf) The entry of a powerful lobby of commission agents and deal fixers of transactions involving public-sector corporations and agencies bred further corruption. \n \ne) Some economic actors, allegedly abetted by public servants, acquired affluence from illegal/ criminal activities (trade in drugs, arms and ammunition, smuggling, misdeclaration of prices of imports and exports and the \u2018hundi\u2019 market for foreign currency, etc). \n \nf) Rampant tax evasion of the resulting incomes and the protection of dysfunctional and tainted administrative systems reinforced the inequalities in favour of the segments of society mentioned. \n \nThe dominant ethos of policy favours and abuse of powers have triggered the creation of a political, social and cultural value system rooted in paternalistic and personal relations, nepotism and patronage and violation of laws. The state has become a hostage to the perceptions of these interest groups on how Pakistan\u2019s political, bureaucratic and economic formations should be organised, resulting in venality and the misuse of powers becoming institutionalised, leading to further imbalance in income and asset distribution. \n \nTo grasp the nature and scale of inequalities, the following data would be instructive: i) whereas the ratio in shares of incomes of the top 20 per cent and bottom 20pc households was roughly five to one in 2000 it had risen to beyond eight by 2015-16; ii) While this ratio was, say, eight, the ratio of tax incidence between the two groups was below two, reflecting the regressive nature of the tax regime that has been pursued and greater reliance on indirect taxes for revenue generation; iii) the cheapest imported luxury car costs 20 years\u2019 income of a household in the bottom 20pc! \n \nThese growing disparities have manifested themselves in the imports of luxury cars (and the resulting imports of parts and more petrol), designer clothes, expensive mobile phones, generators for domestic use, solar panels and food items, foreign exchange for financing foreign education and travel abroad for recreational purposes and deluxe-style pilgrimages. \n \nThe constitution and quality of economic growth as reflected in the items (goods and services) imported for consumption or to feed domestic production configurations has determined the composition and size of the economy and consumption patterns, and thereby the industrial structure, the production technology and the level and skill mix of employment. The free play of market forces has reinforced the inequalities. \n \nMeanwhile, cheap external inflows (because of fortuitous international events at various times) have managed to keep the state afloat. This has enabled postponement of basic reforms, with short-sighted elites happy with the augmentation of their personal fortunes derived from the implementation of such a strategy, while the rest of the country continued to operate below potential. \n \nTo conclude, the emerging sectors of the economy and discriminatory state policies and actions that favoured certain interest groups and classes have exacerbated income disparities. And its worsening has not only been the key determinant of the outcome on the external front but has also exposed the sustainability of the prevailing model and pattern of growth. \n \nThe soft options of the past (concessional aid, remittances, bounties that became available from events like the Cold War, the Afghan war, 9/11etc;) that enabled the elite to postpone fundamental restructuring of this crumbling state and associated political-economic ties, are not likely to be available in such abundance in future. Therefore, addressing the economic issues stemming from the consumption demands of those with large disposable incomes will eventually require basic, structural reforms to remove the constraints to a more equitable and sustainable growth path. \n \nThe writer is a former governor of the State Bank. \n \nPublished in Dawn, October 7th, 2\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [13, 14, 19, 12, 5, 21, 4, 23, 6], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [13, 15, 6, 23, 4, 14, 21, 5, 19, 12], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [21, 6, 5, 14, 12, 23, 19, 4, 13], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [23, 19, 4, 14, 5, 12, 21, 13, 6], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 23, 13, 6, 14, 12, 19, 21, 5, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Green Buddha Group will transfer to JVCo licences to operate CANNABIS facility.\nMichigan is the third-largest cannabis market in the United States.\nIt is estimated that recreational sales could total $1.5-billion.\nGreen Buddha is already well positioned in Michigan and will be able to leverage the influx of capital in implementing a strategic growth plan.", "text": "CAPTOR CAPITAL ENTERS INTO LETTER OF INTENT TO ACQUIRE MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IN MICHIGAN CANNABIS OPPORTUNITY \n\nCaptor Capital Corp. has entered into a letter of intent to form a joint venture company (JVCo) with Green Buddha Group LLC, a company with significant cannabis assets in Michigan, including retail operations currently generating sales, and cultivation and manufacturing facilities presently under development. \n\nIn accordance with the terms of the LOI, Green Buddha will transfer to JVCo Michigan licences to operate 20 retail medical cannabis retailers, two licences to operate a cannabis manufacturing, processing and extraction facility, and eight licences to operate a 325,000-square-foot cannabis cultivation facility.

Following is the statement made by H.E. Ambassador Reza Najafi at the Board of Governors of IAEA on \n\nIsraeli Nuclear Capabilities:\n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nIn line with the NAM position, the issue of Israeli nuclear capability was raised by distinguished ambassador of Kuwait on behalf of Arab Group, and while sharing their concerns on the issue, I would like to restate the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran as follows: \n\nThe Israeli nuclear capability with the exclusive military purpose has always been a source of serious concern for the peoples of the region and international community. The Heads of State or Government of the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM) in the Final Document of its 16th Summit expressed concern over the acquisition of nuclear capability by Israel, which poses a serious and continuing threat to the security of neighboring and other States. \n\nThey also condemned it for continuing to develop and stockpile nuclear arsenals. In the same document, they \u201creiterated their support for the efforts of the Arab Group in Vienna to keep the question of the Israeli nuclear capabilities under consideration\u201d at the IAEA. They urged that the continued consideration of this issue in the context of the IAEA is completely relevant. \n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nSince 1982, the IAEA has passed several resolutions, made decisions and called upon this regime to promptly accede to the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and put all of its clandestine nuclear facilities under the Agency\u2019s full scope safeguards. Furthermore, the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference recalled \u201cthe reaffirmation by the 2000 Review Conference of the importance of Israel\u2019s accession to the Treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards'. \n\nIgnoring the legitimate international concerns by refraining to adhere to the NPT, this regime with blind support of some countries, continuously advances its unlawful nuclear capabilities with the hidden involvement of certain States, in flagrant breach of all international norms and regulations. \n\nContrary to the statement made by the then Prime Minister of Israel on 11 December 2006, related to the possession of nuclear weapons by Israel which was strongly condemned by NAM, when asked by CNN, in a clear lie its current prime minister denied having nuclear weapons. It is crystal clear that clandestine nuclear weapon program of this regime not only jeopardizes the regional and global security but also seriously undermines the Agency\u2019s verification mechanism.\n\nAs it was also called by the NAM, there must be the total and complete prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material and facilities, resources or devices and the extension of assistance in the nuclear related scientific or technological fields to Israel. \n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran expresses its deep concern over the serious negative implications on security in the region as well as the reliability of the global non-proliferation regime whereby Israeli scientists are generously provided access to the nuclear facilities of certain Nuclear Weapon States (NWSs) where they gathered thousands of pages of documents on development of nuclear weapons. \n\nSuch access has been provided to scientists of a non-party to the NPT with an underground nuclear military program while nuclear scientists of NPT Parties have been assassinated all over the Middle East by terrorists recruited by this regime. Nuclear weapons in the hands of such regime with a history full of aggression, occupation and state-terrorism is a real threat to the international peace and security. \n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nThe failure of the NPT 2015 Review Conference due to the position of 3 countries, in support of a non-party to the NPT is a serious setback and regrettable. States Parties to the Treaty, in the first and second sessions of the Preparatory Committee of upcoming NPT Review Conference, held respectively in May 2017 here in Vienna and in April 2018 in Geneva, expressed their concern on such failure. \n\nTherefore, my delegation is of the view that pending the materialization of the international community\u2019s call for the adherence of Israel to the NPT without any condition and placement of all its clandestine nuclear facilities under the full-scope safeguards of the IAEA, it is quite reasonable that the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities, as a real threat to the international peace and security remains on the agenda of the IAEA.\n\nReporter: Hadi Nadri\n\n1396**1396\n\nFollow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [14, 15, 5, 21, 13, 4, 19, 12, 23, 6], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [4, 21, 23, 19, 12, 6, 13, 14, 15, 5], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [13, 23, 6, 5, 21, 19, 12, 4, 14], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 12, 19, 21, 14, 4, 5, 13], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [13, 15, 5, 4, 12, 14, 21, 19, 6, 23, 15], "scores": [0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Cherie R .

Photo: Reuters   \nFormer England defender Rio Ferdinand believes the youthful nature of England's squad proved to be their undoing in the semi-final. \n \n\"I think experience was a telling factor today,\" Ferdinand told the BBC. \"This Croatian team had medals all over the squad but now is not the time to knitpick. This bunch of players have brought the nation together and the fans haven't sung like this for years. \n \n\"We wanted this team to come out with an identity and a philosophy of playing, and I think they have done that. Where we were sat in the stadium, people around us were impressed with England's football and their ability to play out from the back. \n \n\"Kieran Trippier's delivery of the ball was brilliant and what a tournament he has had. There were question marks over Jordan Pickford but he was the best choice in goal and this team can develop into something very strong. I have been an admirer of John Stones for a long time, and he defended unbelievably today. We have got a very inexperienced young squad but they have grown and will continue to do so.\" \n \nEx-England striker Alan Shearer also tried to find the positives amid England's anguish. \n \n\"We said before the tournament that if they gave absolutely everything in every game, everyone at home would be happy,\" said Shearer. \n \n\"England got off to a very good start and dominated the first 45 minutes but Croatia stepped 10 yards further forward in the second half. \n \n\"Luka Modric bossed the midfield and we could not get near him with his deft touches and passes, he was superb and a man of the match performance, a vital cog for them. We lacked experience to get someone on him and stop him. Croatia did not panic when they fell behind. \n \n\"Kieran Trippier was brilliant in the tournament and so was Jordan Pickford, especially with his delivery. Harry Kane was a bit quiet in the knockout games and he had a chance that he could not put away \n \n\"So many positives to take out of the tournament, we did not expect to get to the quarters and will go home after this without heads held high.

It's about a woman who tries to exorcise the ghost of her deceased mother through writing. As memories of her mother, a biracial woman from Haiti who passed for white in the largely Jim Crow South, force themselves into the daughter's mind, she chronicles, fearlessly, the pain and confusion that both of them suffered as they tried to find their way in a segregated, class-bound world.\n\nEach section concentrates on an aspect of the author's experience, but none tells a straight story. Photographs, snippets of songs, moments of longing and regret, scenes of confusion, loss and horror become part of a mesmeric whole. The narrative starts and stops, doesn't play by the usual temporal rules. Dayan's story refuses to obey the logic of linear time, questions the finality of death, upends rationalist notions of cause and effect, and reproduces over and over the chaotic, un-rule-governed quality of actual human experience.\n\n\"In the Belly of Her Ghost\" does not make unsettling assertions about the nature of reality in an explicit way; they are not the point of the story but its unavoidable substance. When your mother dies and comes back as a spider and makes droplets of blood appear on the walls, when her spidery presence is stamped on the veins of your own eye -- anything to get attention -- the supernatural is not a matter of belief but of life as you lived it.\n\nWe sense the author reasoning to herself: Maybe if she can call her mother up on the page, dress her in ball gowns and jewels, capture the stunning beauty of her face and form, call her to account for her life of pretense -- pretending to be white, to be upper middle class, to belong at the country club -- but also sympathize with her for the agony this caused her, maybe if we can be made to see how unhappy she was with the husband who commanded this performance, and see how unable to support and care for her child she was since she herself hardly existed, maybe then, the author hopes, the mother will finally be able to let go.\n\nOr maybe it's the other way around.\n\nIn her repeated visits to Haiti, where her mother was born, in carrying her mother's paintings, silver, china, crystal with her when she moves to take a prestigious job, in poring over the photographs of her mother that her father took compulsively, in remembering the lust in her mother's voice on the phone with a lover, her absence at school functions, perhaps Dayan is trying to possess the mother she never really had.\n\nShe had a real mother, though, just not the one who bore her. Lucille, the African American maid who cared for Colin, was everything her mother was not: racially unambiguous, real and there. If Dayan's mother haunts the book -- destructive, passionate and despairing -- Lucille cuts through the posturing with reminders of mortality. Lucille, writes Dayan, \"gave me the chance not to live a lie.\" Lucille patched her clothes, sang to her, approved of the world of snakes, frogs and spiders that Colin loved. Lucille understood things that were alive, things that could kill, things that died. \"Bugs and dirt\" is what it all comes down to in the end, said Lucille, \"bugs and dirt.\"\n\nThe memoir insists on the uncanny power of physical objects, makes them come alive.

But Jennings, who actually shared the quote above in a recent interview with Ars, is smart enough to recognize that most people don't find the same joy in \"pure\" trivia tests that he does. \nARS TECHNICA \nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica , a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast. \n\n\"If trivia is just knowledge retrieval, it's only fun if you get it right,\" Jennings told Ars. \"It shouldn't just be middle-aged dads trading baseball statistics ... It can involve deduction and lateral thinking, different kinds of cognition other than, 'Do I remember this thing my 9th grade teacher taught me.' One is fun, the other is fun only to a very, very small group of people.\" \n\nRichard Garfield, the storied creator of Magic: The Gathering (and, more recently, Valve's Artifact ), came to a similar conclusion after reading Jennings' book, Brainiac . \"I was really taken by his love of trivia,\" Garfield said. \"I learned to see trivia as being more than just a black-or-white test of whether you know it or not. Good trivia questions have an art to them, and have many more dimensions.\" \n\nAnd so, a bit more than five years ago, Garfield reached out to Jennings to \"make a trivia game that really brought those elements out.\" Today, on Kickstarter , they're finally ready to unveil Half-Truth , their attempt to turn the world of trivia games on its ear. \n\nAs a game designer, Garfield's first task in making his own trivia game was to focus on the pain points that make standard trivia quizzes so unsatisfying for many.\n\"I thought back to my evenings playing trivia games, and I saw that one of the frustrating things was when I hit a long period of time where I knew nothing, or nothing that wasn't known by almost everyone there,\" Garfield said. \"Then the one question where I was a master at the subject, where I was the only person who knew, that question got asked to someone else. So right off the bat, I resolved that everybody should be answering every question.\" \n\nGarfield also decided to stick with multiple choice questions, so players would always have a potential \"hook\" that could provide some insight into the answer. After testing cards with one right answer out of six choices, though, Garfield says he \"moved to the much more interesting place\" where three out of the six options were correct (or \"half\" true). \n\nThat means, at worst, players have a 50 percent chance of stumbling on a right answer every time. And even if they don't know the answer, players can improve those chances by eliminating answers they know are wrong or looking for patterns and groupings in the options. \n\nGarfield gave an example from testing where a card asked players to identify which of the six options were types of mushrooms. The three wrong answers\u2014Destroying Angel, Blinding Angel, and Thallid\u2014were drawn from Magic: The Gathering cards (perhaps not surprisingly, as the question was written by Garfield's wife). \"This was sort of eye-opening for me; that was a clever way to make it so there were more angles into this card. If you know Magic cards real well, you don't need to know mushrooms at all.\" \n\nFor the \"trivia jocks\" who might play the game, there's also the option to push your luck and identify two or three answers. This gives you a slight bonus if you're correct but eliminates all of that turn's progress if you get even one choice wrong, introducing some basic risk-versus-reward strategy to the design. \n\nTrivia games are usually lopsided based on who just happens to know (and can retrieve) more trivial information from their brains. But Garfield says Half-Truth 's design \"gives you this start down an egalitarian path where everybody's got a chance,\" but without making the playing field completely flat. \n\n\"The people who aren't as trivia savvy will feel like they've got more of a chance,\" Garfield said. \"Maybe they won't win, but they'll have their victories. I often try to create my games so that skillful play is an advantage, but it doesn't mean you win every single time.\" \n\nThe hope is to make each question in Half-Truth a bit of a logic puzzle that can be solved, rather than a pure test of recall. \"Right in front of you [on each card] there are three right answers,\" Jennings pointed out. \"They are right there ... you're trying to solve the riddle, figure out which is which.\" \n\nJennings recalled winning the first Half-Truth test game he played with Garfield, after a year of development, and thinking, \"Yes, exactly, this is how the universe should work. I should win trivia games.\" When they played again, though, Jennings lost, \"and I thought, this is a very smart game, because sometimes the trivia expert has a small edge, but that's not always enough ... The result is it's the rare trivia game where you remember feeling smart when you play. \n\n\"People don't feel well-informed,\" Jennings added by way of explaining the paralysis many people feel around trivia games. \"We're a very information dense society today. And people feel like they don't know enough stuff. We're constantly feeling bad about the stuff that we know. \n\n\"The beauty of trivia is that opposite feeling, when something inside your head actually pays off,\" he continued. \"That's such an amazing epiphany because it happens so rarely. We spend all this effort stuffing facts into out head, then occasionally, at a trivia board, something turns into real life points and it's delightful. Half-Truth is structured to give more people that experience.\" \n\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica ."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [13, 19, 5, 21, 4, 14, 6, 12, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [21, 5, 4, 12, 6, 23, 13, 19, 14], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 12, 13, 4, 5, 21, 23, 19, 14], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [14, 19, 4, 13, 23, 12, 6, 21, 5], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [6, 21, 12, 23, 5, 15, 19, 14, 13, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Chamber of Deputies approved to convene person in charge of office of the Attorney General of the Republic, Alberto El\u00edas Beltr\u00e1n.\nSenate urged the PGR and the foreign ministry to request permission for arrest warrant for forced disappearance.\nIt was agreed to request to proceed with urgency to apply the domain extinction that allows to recover assets the former governor of Veracruz illegally appropriated.", "text": "V\u00edctor Ballinas, Andrea Becerril, Roberto Gardu\u00f1o and Enrique M\u00e9ndez La Jornada Newspaper \n\n Friday, September 28, 2018, p. 4  After the sentence of nine years of prison dictated against the former governor of Veracruz Javier Duarte de Ochoa, the Chamber of Deputies approved to convene the person in charge of the office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR), Alberto El\u00edas Beltr\u00e1n, with the purpose that explain the terms of the negotiation in the process.

(Boldface names along the lines of Lady Gaga and Enrique Iglesias fill up the rest.) Working with that kind of talent is one of the perks of being one of the best in the FOH business. \n \nBut like many, Kimball\u2019s original plan was to be one of those rock & roll stars himself. \u201cI was a musician first,\u201d he says, \u201cbut just by having to be my own sound guy, I started to fall in love by twisting knobs. At some point, I realized I couldn\u2019t really make a living and support my family by playing in a band\u2014but I realized I could do that by doing sound for bands. So I just bounced over, and one band just kind of led to another.\u201d \n \nThis summer, that path has led to a gig with Tears for Fears, who are on an arena tour co-headlining with another pair of \u201980s superstars, Hall & Oates.

For a sound guy, it\u2019s really rare to be working with a band like that. With them, it\u2019s like mixing a record in a studio every day. These guys are just phenomenal\u2014and they\u2019re great human beings on top of that.\u201d \n \nGiven his status in the FOH universe, Kimball could probably get his hands on any piece of gear he wants. But when he recently was in the market for a preamp, he made the decision to incorporate Focusrite\u2019s ISA 828 eight-channel microphone preamp into his arsenal. \u201cI was searching around for preamps,\u201d he says \u201csomething I could use in a rack setup. I was looking at Neve, but the cost and the fact that they weren\u2019t built in a rack style meant that wasn\u2019t ideal; I didn\u2019t want to be physically stacking those boxes all the time. Then I came across the 828, saw that it had eight channels of Focusrite pres in a 2U rack space, and said, \u2018Okay, let me check this out.\u2019\u201d \n \nNeedless to say, Kimball liked what he found, and quickly added the ISA 828 to his set-up. \u201cI thought it would be a good idea to incorporate a splitter, set it up so that everything went into the 828s first, and then slid out to both monitors and front of house,\u201d he explains \u201cThat way, we were all getting the preamp sound. And we can get the best of both worlds\u2014we get analog on the front end, and then we can still have the conveniences of the digital world, with recall and all that. I\u2019ll tell you, when we started rehearsals, my jaw was on the ground, like \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of this a long time ago?\u201d The monitor guy, who\u2019s been working with Tears for Fears for four years himself, was the same: \u2018Why didn\u2019t we do this years ago?\u2019\u201d \n \nA major factor leading to Kimball\u2019s adoption of the ISA 828 was the preamp\u2019s tonal quality. Befitting his love for classic sounds, he fell in love with the luxurious richness that the unit offers\u2014which, as it happens, is based on a design created by Rupert Neve in 1985 for Sir George Martin\u2019s AIR Studios. \u201cThe 828 just warmed everything up, and gave me tones I hadn\u2019t heard for years, bringing in those second and third harmonic tones,\u201d he says. \u201cSpecifically with Tears for Fears, the bass tone had always been a bit thin and clanky. So what I tried was to bring in a diaphragm microphone to replace what we had been using, then put the Focusrite pres on both channels\u2014and it completely changed the sound of that bass. It sounded so warm. I thought, there it is! That\u2019s the sound I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d \n \nThat attention to sound quality is what makes Kimball one of the most in-demand FOH engineers around\u2014but what really keeps him going is the thrill of the show itself. \u201cThe studio thing doesn\u2019t float my boat,\u201d he admits. You can be sitting there all day working on a kick drum. \u201cWhat I like is the adrenaline of a live show, when the house is dark and things are about to start and you\u2019re thinking, okay\u2014time to make it happen. The energy is great; the vibe is great. The thing about live music is it\u2019s only that one night.

It was pointed out that with a dismally narrow tax base of Sales Tax registered persons comprising hardly 35000 in number, it is virtually impossible for the importers, manufacturers and suppliers of goods to find registered buyers or those willing to provide their CNIC details. Consequently the inventories of unsold goods with traders, stockists, importers and manufacturers are piling up, blocking their entire working capital as well as the funds borrowed from banks. The overnight change has put entire trade and industry in a quandary as to whether or not to continue in business because it is simply not possible to find registered buyers or those willing to provide their CNIC. \n\nKCCI and other trade bodies are overwhelmed with complaints from traders, importers, manufacturers and dealers to take up this serious issue with Finance Ministry and FBR to find a workable solution immediately to pre-empt a crisis within the trade and industry, he added.

This virus causes severe diarrhea, nausea, and stomach pain. \n \nAlthough often referred to as the \u201ccruise ship\u201d virus in the United States, noroviruses are an expensive and serious public health problem particularly among young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised patients. Now, in a new study published in Immunity this week, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have used a mouse model to show that, even in immunized animals, noroviruses can escape the immune system and still spread by hiding out in an extremely rare type of cell in the gut. \n \n\u201cCurrent vaccines against norovirus have been ineffective despite eliciting strong antibody responses,\u201d said senior author E. John Wherry, PhD, a professor of Microbiology and director of the Penn Institute for Immunology. \u201cUnderstanding the unique norovirus characteristic of hiding from the host immune system may explain its biology and present opportunities to improve vaccines and therapeutics.\u201d \n \nWhile most infected people clear the virus within a few days, some individuals continue to shed virus for weeks to months after. Such persistently infected people may be a source of outbreaks, but it was unclear why the immune system fails to eliminate the virus in these cases. \n \n\u201cThe cruise ship outbreaks of norovirus are high profile, but it happens everywhere \u2013 daycare centers, eldercare facilities, and more,\u201d said first author Vesselin T. Tomov, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Gastroenterology. \u201cNoroviruses can cause persistent infections, challenging the long-held view that they are transient pathogens.\u201d \n \nThe Penn investigators defined and tracked T-cell responses in mice infected with either an acute or chronic strain of mouse norovirus to gain insight into mechanisms of viral clearance and persistence. At first, they hypothesized that persistent norovirus infection caused T cells to become exhausted rendering them non-functioning, similar to other chronic viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C. To their surprise, however, T cells remained functional even after months of norovirus infection. \n \nThe team then looked at the earliest stages of response by the immune system and found two phases to that response. During the initial days after infection, T cells reacted strongly to the virus and controlled it. But, after about three days, T cells could no longer detect norovirus in 50 to 70 percent of the mice infected with the chronic strain. \n \nThe researchers faced a paradox because the T cells responding to the virus appeared \u201cignorant\u201d or \u201cunable to see\u201d the virus, yet there was continuous shedding of norovirus in mouse feces. To explain this conundrum, they next hypothesized that actively multiplying norovirus had been sequestered somewhere in the gut out of reach of T cells. \n \nTomov conducted a series of experiments to test that hypothesis. He eventually found evidence that norovirus does hide in rare gut cells that fail to communicate with T cells and alert them of the presence of the pathogen. \u201cWe found a novel escape mechanism where norovirus becomes essentially invisible to the immune system in the intestine while still producing large amounts of virus that is shed from the intestines,\u201d Tomov said. \n \nCoauthors at Washington University have found that norovirus hides in specialized, ultra-rare cells of the gut lining, on the order of only a few hundred cells out of the billions that line the mouse gut. These cells act as mega factories for norovirus production, while allowing the virus to evade the immune system. The team is now working on this aspect of norovirus infection. \n \nThese findings might help explain why norovirus vaccines being tested have shown limited effectiveness and also hint that future vaccines would need to elicit immunity that acts very robustly in the first three days after infection before the virus moves into hiding. The results also dovetail with the fact that no one has yet found an animal reservoir for the virus. \u201cThere may be some people out there who are living with the chronic strain of the virus and are persistently, yet unknowingly, shedding it,\u201d Tomov said. \n \nNext, the researchers plan to investigate how to improve protection against this virus by combining T cell and antibody approaches for vaccines. Identifying the cellular reservoir of norovirus may also enable the development of therapeutics to help prevent or purge persisting infection. In addition, testing whether similar mechanisms occur in humans is a major goal that will not only enable better vaccine development, but also help test for a potential role of norovirus as a co-factor in other intestinal diseases. \n Chinese \u00a0French \u00a0German \u00a0Italian \u00a0Japanese \u00a0Korean \u00a0Portuguese \u00a0Russian \u00a0Spanish"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [19, 14, 4, 5, 12, 21, 23, 6, 13], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [5, 13, 6, 23, 19, 12, 21, 4, 14], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [21, 5, 23, 14, 12, 19, 6, 13, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [19, 21, 13, 14, 23, 5, 12, 6, 4], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [23, 14, 13, 6, 12, 4, 21, 19, 15, 5], "scores": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "I have a simple, rallying cry: women need to do more with their money.I'm not saying I'm an expert.\nDespite spending almost a decade interviewing the world's top investors about their strategies and mindset as a financial journalist, I struggled to even bring myself to open an ISA.", "text": "I have a simple, rallying cry: women need to do more with their money.I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m an expert.

After all, most of us didn\u2019t get financial education at school, and I think a lesson on pensions or how to send an invoice would have been more useful than weekly experiments in Home Economics about how much baking soda can ruin a brownie.In my defence, it\u2019s tempting to be apathetic in a world where most of the \u201cbenefits\u201d of products like pensions and ISAs benefit the truly rich. Getting on the property ladder is almost impossible \u2013 most of us need our parents to help out. The cycle of poverty is real, and money only makes more money if you have it in the first place.My third excuse is that money, for some unfathomable reason, is put in the same category as rocket science \u2013 technical, detailed, irrelevant \u2013 or it\u2019s seen as an imminent disaster, with American pundits screaming on cable news about the latest hot stock or announcement by the central bank. We put money experts on a pedestal and worship them \u2013 and that didn\u2019t turn out so well for former fund manager star Neil Woodford. But money is not an exclusive club. For example, we don\u2019t need to be up to speed on the ramifications of every by-election to take an interest in politics. We also don\u2019t need to know the direction of equity markets (they normally go up over the long term anyway) or know the interest rate of a government bond to sort out our finances. So, the million-dollar question: how can I get better with my money? One is learning, and talking to other people about their finances. Taking small steps at a time. Deciding what I really want and focusing on my goals, rather than saving for a future I don\u2019t know is going to happen. (Despite women\u2019s mags advising me to the contrary, I refuse to give up my takeaway coffee most days \u2013 I get a discount with my KeepCup.) I\u2019ve taken some simple steps over the last year instead: consolidate my pensions into one pot; invest in premium bonds; open a stocks and shares ISA; put aside 30 per cent of my income to pay tax and student loan, and cut down on what I spend i.e. subscriptions and fast fashion.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent eventsThere is a higher purpose here, I like to think. In the UK, there is a very significant gender pay gap (8.6 per cent for full-time workers), a gender pension gap (almost 40 per cent in 2017/18) and a gender investment gap, (YouGov research shows that 52 per cent of women have never put their money into an investment product, compared to 37 per cent of men). And while what we really need is to change the overarching structures that affect those gaps i.e. corporate transparency and legislation \u2013 in the meantime we can at least gain confidence in our own money matters.And we should gain confidence, because research shows that women make good, if not better, investors compared to men. Women are more risk averse, and less emotional. As someone who has interviewed the man who brought down Barings Bank in the 1990s through excessive risk taking, I believe this to be true.\n\nIn other words, I want to shake that magic money tree.

The hashtag #JusticeForZainab has been trending on various social media platforms and has caught the attention of multiple prime time international media outlets. \n   \nAdvertisements \n     \nAdvertisements \n   \nThe parents of the 8-year-old had gone to Saudi Arabia to fulfill their pilgrimage and left Zainab in the hands of her Kasuri relatives. The sudden disappearance of Zainab had pushed her relatives to approach local authorities; however, no extensive effort was made to find her as the police showed no concern . Seeing the lack of interest taken by the police, the community began a search and rescue operation, and after several days of hunting, they were able to locate Zainab's dead body. \n \n\"My relatives and neighbours told [me] that the police used to come, have food, and leave,\" recalled Ameen Ansari, the father of the victim. \"While they didn't do anything, my friends and family spent day and night looking for my daughter,\" he told the local media. \n Protesters vs. Police  \nProtesters then stormed into local government offices and the police station demanding justice for Zainab, as the rapist had not been taken into custody. \n   \nAdvertisements \n   \nThe #angry protest eventually transformed into a violent scuffle, killing two people and leaving a dozen injured. In a Tweet, government officials confirmed the arrest of a few of the police for opening fire on the demonstrators. \n \nJibran Nasir, lawyer and social activist, blames the federal and local governments for such incidents. He says, \"The federal and provincial governments should revise the education curriculum and include topics on sexual abuse .\" He vows to take measures to empower children, and protect them from sexual advances and rampant pedophilia. \n Rising paedophilia in Pakistan  \nBefore Zainab, roughly 700 cases of paedophilia have been reported to the media and local police. Last November, 6-year-old Zainab Batool was kidnapped while coming back from a store, a few yards from her home. She was later found unconscious, with torn clothing and a bruised face, in a heap of trash at the local wholesale market. \n Is there a fix?  \nIn an international study conducted during 2012, Pakistan was ranked the highest in watching online pornography. \n   \nAdvertisements \n   \nThough officially banned, consumers received access via various VPN configurations. Evidently, sexual deprivation is the largest reason that the lives of young children, boys and girls alike, are being ruined. So what's the fix? Who should we be protecting our kids from? Knowing how rapidly a disease like pedophilia is increasing in Pakistani society, and seeing how the police are least interested in these cases, who should the government appoint to control such an epidemic ? Should local authorities with power be more attentive to these cases? Should local schools be more articulate when explaining topics related to sex? Overall, the sexually frustrated people of this country need to control their urges. They shouldn't be assaulting kids or destroying their youthful sense of security, just to satisfy their own taboo needs. #Republic Of Pakistan\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [14, 13, 19, 4, 5, 12, 6, 23, 21], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [15, 4, 21, 5, 15, 12, 13, 19, 6, 14, 23], "scores": [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [12, 21, 14, 15, 5, 23, 13, 6, 19, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [23, 12, 14, 6, 5, 21, 15, 4, 13, 19], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [13, 15, 12, 21, 5, 6, 14, 23, 4, 19], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "President Buhari accepted the minister's resignation from his cabinet on Friday, September 14, 2018.\nAdeosun reportedly resigned from Buhari's cabinet on Friday, September 14, 2018,following weeks of pressure over forgery allegations .\nA source in the presidency disclosed to Pulse that the minister tendered her resignation letter to the office of the president earlier in the week, even though she was still on her desk at the time of filing this story.  play Nigerians react to Kemi Adeosun's resignation over NYSC certificate forgery allegation.", "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has accepted Kemi Adeosun 's resignation as Nigeria's minister of Finance.  \nPresident Buhari accepted the minister's resignation from his cabinet on Friday, September 14, 2018. \n \nAdeosun reportedly resigned from Buhari's cabinet on Friday, September 14, 2018,following weeks of pressure over forgery allegations . \n \nALSO READ : Adeosun resigns as Buhari's minister following NYSC scandal \n \nA source in the presidency disclosed to Pulse that the minister tendered her resignation letter to the office of the president earlier in the week, even though she was still on her desk at the time of filing this story. \n play  Nigerians react to Kemi Adeosun's resignation over NYSC certificate forgery allegation.

Christopher Layne, distinguished Professor of International Affairs and Robert M. Gates Chair in National Security at the Bush School of Government and Public Service, argues that global power is shifting from West to East, leading to an American decline in influence and loss of global dominance. Those who support this notion often table the following grounds or arguments.\n\nDue to its policies in the Middle East and Latin America, America lost its soft power influence over other countries. At home, the state of permanent impasse in Congress is making it extremely difficult to make any progress in making decisions or reforming outdated and often counterproductive laws. Some even compare the United States with the British Empire, referring to its collapse a century ago. But, at the very least, this viewpoint suggests that America has lost the favour of many countries. Meanwhile, China has reached the status of a great power and globalization has become omnipresent. Stephen Walt, Belfer Professor of International Affairs at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, argues that 'the real issue is whether developments at home and overseas are making it harder for the United States to exercise the kind of dominant influence that it did for much of the later half of the 20th century.' According to this view, the United States is not declining and is still one of the most powerful countries in the world, but its capacity to lead global order has been diminished due to the array of domestic and foreign policy failures. The post Cold War international affairs culture endorses this truth.\n\nIn his book 'The China Choice', Hugh White fleshes this out with three arguments. First, 'as India emerges as a great power in its own right\u2026its aim will be to maximise its own power, not support America's.' Second, 'the stronger India becomes, the less it will need America to help balance China.' And third, 'the stronger China is relative to India, the more cautious Delhi will be about sacrificing its interest in a good relationship with Beijing.' To examine this emerging American-Indian geopolitical landscape , three factors determine the scope of this relationship: Firstly because they saw that benefits might accrue from being seen as valuable partners; secondly because the success and consequent emboldening of a regional hegemon would threaten them in the future; and thirdly, perhaps also because they had some commitment to, and interest in, basic norms of international conduct, such as preservation of the territorial status quo. It is not hard to see how each of these three dynamics could characterize a future Asian conflict. China's heft works both ways: it dissuades middle powers from exposing themselves to a US-China fight. India has a wide range of interests at stake in its relationship with China and India cannot afford to subordinate those interests to the concerns of America or Japan, or Australia.'\n\nThe first part may be partly true, but the second is less clear. India might well bandwagon in some areas becoming gradually more interoperable with the US, and balance in others, continuing to work at odds with Washington on, say, trade or climate change. Up to a point, one can indeed disaggregate these different economic/diplomatic and security/military elements. While many security and foreign policy analysts criticized US President Donald Trump's Afghanistan policy for lacking a clear-cut strategy, Trump's Afghanistan policy and Washington's obsession towards India has the potential to alter the geopolitical balance in the volatile region, thereby making peace incompatible with regional dynamics. It is logical to think that Pakistan considered India the main enemy, and knowing that the US wanted India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, it was logical that Islamabad would get closer to Beijing. 'Pakistani authorities think that cooperating with China would be more useful for them in this scenario than working with the US. China, too, is supporting Pakistan on all regional and international forums,' the expert underlined.\n\nNo wonder then, that there are renewed calls within the US to restore a workable relationship with Pakistan. As the conservative US think tank, Hudson Institute put it in a recent report. A New Approach to Pakistan, 'the Trump Administration should both publicly and privately maintain avenues for Pakistan to become a US ally, as well as trade and investment partner, in the future'.The latest developments show the new US strategy, which seeks a bigger role for Pakistan's archrival India in the conflict, would drag South Asia towards more peace chaos. Significantly, India's smaller South Asian neighbours are fast moving towards developing closer relationships with China. Although this is generally perceived as an anti-India phenomenon, the reality is that Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are looking up to China as a new guarantor of help in the face of the US' heavy-handed approach towards them.\n\nAntoine Levesques, IISS Research Associate for South Asia, expected China to play a more 'pro-active' role in Afghanistan into 2018, foremost diplomatically. But this posture would be conditioned by security developments in the country; details within, or any evolutions of, the US strategy's framework; the outcome of Trump's planned visit to Beijing; and China's willingness to take greater risks, including on promoting Afghan reconciliation. The real irony about Trump's segregating South Asia policy lies in Washington's blunt denial of seeking peace priorities as compared to its twisted perusal of strategic interests with India, thereby making US's fragile role in South Asian affairs.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 4, 19, 5, 13, 14, 12, 21], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [23, 13, 6, 21, 5, 19, 14, 12, 4], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 14, 19, 21, 12, 5, 13, 23, 4], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [19, 23, 6, 14, 12, 5, 13, 4, 21], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [21, 15, 23, 4, 12, 14, 6, 13, 5, 19], "scores": [0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "The Peanut Van retails tonnes of fresh , crunchy jumbo - peanuts from its vans and via retailers.\nIn late 2016 , production looked set to soar after the company secured a new national distribution agreement with IGA Foodland.\nManaging director Rob Patch described the equipment as \" really temperamental \"\nThe machinery was a nightmare to wash down , he says.\nIt took three people twelve hours to dissemble the machinery and wash it down.\nDiverseCo company AccuPak has designed a robust , reliable and flexible turnkey solution to acquire new capabilities.", "text": "Aussie icon the Peanut Van recently installed a semi-automatic line to manage product feeding, dosing and bagging of its famous jumbo-peanuts and help it manage a new national distribution agreement with IGA Foodland.  \nThe Peanut Van retails tonnes of fresh, crunchy jumbo-peanuts from its vans and via retailers, and also provides a mail-order service, in addition to attracting tourists to Queensland. \n \nThe company sources its jumbo-sized peanuts from the Peanut Company of Australia (PCA), the central processor for Kingaroy\u2019s peanut farmers. \n \nThese are then hand-cooked and flavoured in weekly batches before packing them into air-tight bags. \n \nThe company, which is one of Kingaroy\u2019s bestknown tourist attractions, was established in 1969, and in late 2016, production looked set to soar after the company secured a new national distribution agreement with IGA Foodland. \n \nHowever, the packaging line machinery that the company was using was causing problems for its owners and operators. Managing director Rob Patch described the equipment as \u201creally temperamental.\u201d \n \nIt would breakdown when they most depended on it, such as when they had big orders to process. One day it might process a tonne of peanuts, and the next day only 15kg. \n \n\u201cOur reputation as being a reliable supplier to our customers was at risk. We had no control.

The Peanut Van was processing twenty two flavours on the same line. \n \nTo prevent cross-contamination of allergens contained within the ingredients, the machinery had to be washed down on a relatively frequent basis. \n \nThe problem was that it took three people twelve hours to dissemble the machinery and wash it down. \u201cWe had to resolve the problems or get out of business,\u201d Patch says. \n \nSo The Peanut Van decided to go out to the marketplace to seek a solution and settled on DiverseCo company AccuPak, a systems integrator of dosing/weighing, packaging, palletising equipment and product inspection systems, to come up with the answers. \n \nTo kick things off, an AccuPak business analyst and engineer reviewed The Peanut Van\u2019s production facilities, processes and packaging line requirement. \n \nThe company then set about to design a robust, reliable and flexible turnkey solution that would enable The Peanut Van to acquire new operational capabilities and set new benchmarks. \n \nRead the rest of this article >>\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [4, 12, 14, 5, 21, 19, 6, 13, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [12, 19, 14, 5, 21, 13, 4, 6, 23], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 4, 5, 6, 12, 23, 21, 14], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [14, 4, 21, 19, 5, 13, 6, 12, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [19, 21, 13, 4, 23, 15, 5, 6, 12, 14], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Dev(Shaheer Sheikh) reaches his room trying to speak to an angry Sona (Erica Fernandes) , she avoids him and when he forces her to talk she says that what he did was wrong as how would he feel if Suhana was carried away like he carried Golu home today.\nSona reaches back home and sits sorting the things as Dev walks in and asks her what more does he not know of her and Sona says she wants Soha to have only good memories.\nSona asks Dev to drop her right there as she has some work and she send Dev and Soha away.", "text": "Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi has pair of worried parents who try tackling their 7years old who suddenly seems to have taken a U -turn from mature and understanding to stubborn and difficult.

Hendrickson was just beginning his search for a new line of work and he did not yet know what would pique his interest. \n \nBut he for sure wasn\u2019t interested in farm work, except as a last resort. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of friends who have had summer jobs, like when they were in high school, picking fruit but I doubt anyone would make a career out of it,\u201d he said. \n \nAccording to local farm sector employers, most workers are paid well above Pennsylvania\u2019s minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Crew chiefs and foremen on some orchards earn close to $19 per hour. Yet few native-born Americans are willing to do this work, even if unemployed says Alan Dudley, administrator of the Gettysburg CareerLink office. \n \n\u201cThe work is difficult, especially in the fields, and it\u2019s not necessarily unskilled work,\" he said. \"Orchard owners want skilled people to harvest apples so they get the best return on their crop.\u201d \n \nAdams County\u2019s farms, orchards, and processing plants are where the jobs are. The so-called \u201cfruit belt\u201d of vast peach and apple orchards extends across the region\u2019s rolling green hills, along with the packing and processing companies and other agricultural-related businesses. \n \nTourism, with the 3 million visitors drawn annually to the historic Civil War battlefield of Gettysburg, is the other main economic generator. \n \nAdams County\u2019s $580-million fruit industry depends heavily on immigrant labor, which is why the country may be facing an unintended consequence of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigrants. \n \nBusinesses in the agricultural-based economy are experiencing labor shortages , and orchard owners are bracing for the possibility of not having enough workers for the fall harvest. \n \nFleeing workforce \n \nLast month, six Hispanic employees of a county fruit-packing company, which does not want to be identified, were picked up by local police and turned over to immigration agents, who sent them to a detention facility. These and other detentions have had a chilling effect on the county\u2019s Hispanic residents, who make up 6.5 percent of the population of some 100,000 people. \n \nYet because of the immigration crackdown, workers are not showing up or in some instances, have fled. The local plant of Hillandale Farms, a major national egg producer and distributor, was desperately seeking to fill vacant jobs this summer, according to a company official, because much of its Hispanic work force had disappeared. \n \nAs the autumn harvest approaches, the demand for labor is accelerating, Dudley says, not just in the orchards but also in the fruit processing and other agriculture-related industries. \n \n\u201cSo they\u2019re coming into their busy hiring season right now. For instance, Knouse Foods just last week posted about eight new positions on our job search website.\u201d \n \n\u2018No roving checkpoints\u2019 \n \nAdams County voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in last November\u2019s presidential election. \n \nAt the Latimore Valley fair in June, which attracted several thousand people to watch antique car races, trucking company secretary Kim Sanders expressed strong support for President Trump\u2019s policy of arresting and deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. \n \n\nBut, echoing the views of others at the fair who were asked the same question, Sanders wants the law-abiding undocumented immigrants to be able to stay. \n \n\u201cI hate to say it but there are not enough American people to go out and work on a farm, or do planting and pick vegetables like they will,\u201d she said. \n \nRepublican Congressman Scott Perry, whose district includes Adams County, has heard the concerns of orchard owners and other businesses in the fruit industry. Perry told VOA his message to them is that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has assured him nothing has changed in its enforcement actions. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s not like roving checkpoints,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re targeted enforcement.\u201d \n \nBut ICE has changed its policies somewhat. Acting-ICE chief Tom Homan told reporters at the White House last month that \u201c\u2026no populations are off the table. So non-criminals, those who have got a court order from a judge that refuse to leave, we\u2019re looking for.\u201d \n \nUnder the last two years of the previous Obama administration, non-criminals were not a priority and were often let go if detained. \n \nGrowers such as Kay Hollabaugh are running out of patience. She met last month with Congressman Perry and local lawmakers to express her concerns about the future of the Adams County fruit belt if the immigrant labor force is driven out. \n \n\u201cThose people who are making the laws of our land, eat every day,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could simply stop producing food for a month - OK, no food, no food - I think perhaps that would make some bells go off.\u201d \n\nRipening fruit \n \nThe Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy has galvanized activists in Adams County to press for immigration reform and to lobby local lawmakers to vote against measures that would target immigrant communities. \n \nJenny Dumont, a Spanish professor at Gettysburg College who leads the immigration lobbying effort for a grassroots group called \u201cGettysburg Rising, blames the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric for creating unwarranted fears about the undocumented. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty well documented that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans,\u201d Dumont said. \u201cMy sense is that people, if they\u2019ve had contact with immigrants here, that they understand the contributions that they make, they\u2019re able to see them as people not just the label immigrant, the other.\u201d \n \nBut Congressman Perry said the border would have to be secured before Americans would agree to any immigration reform measure. \n \n\u201cIf you just seal the border without doing some of these other reforms, we\u2019re going to have problems from a business standpoint as well, and I think they get that but again there\u2019s this mistrust,\" he said. \"They want to see action not words,\u201d the congressman said referring to border security. \n \nAs the push and pull over immigration policy plays out, farmers may get some relief as the federal government issues more visas for temporary agricultural workers, mainly from Mexico. The U.S. Labor Department has issued 20 percent more H-2A visas in 2017, compared to last year. Those visas are for seasonal agricultural work, such as harvesting berries, fruit or other crops. \n \nBut the visas require require farmers to demonstrate that no Americans will take the jobs they offer. In the meantime, the apple crop is ripening on the trees in Adams County. With harvesting about to begin in less than a month, orchard owners are not sure if enough workers will show up. \n \nKay Hollabaugh repeated what a top executive of a major food processor told her recently: \u201c\u2019If fruit goes, the Adams County economy falls and we\u2019re out of business.\u2019\u201d"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [5, 19, 12, 14, 21, 4, 6, 23, 13], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [4, 12, 13, 19, 23, 6, 14, 21, 5], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [12, 21, 14, 5, 6, 23, 13, 19, 4], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [13, 19, 4, 6, 5, 23, 12, 21, 14], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 13, 19, 12, 15, 4, 6, 23, 5, 14, 21], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Christopher Layne argues that global power is shifting from West to East.\nChina has reached the status of a great power... globalization has become omnipresent.\nBut this viewpoint suggests America has lost the favour of many countries.\nChina has reached the status of a great power and globalization has become omnipresent.\nThe real issue is whether developments at home and overseas are making it harder to exercise the kind of dominant influence that it did for much of the later half of the 20th century '.'\nThe post Cold War international affairs culture endorses this truth.\nIndia has a wide range of interests at stake in its relationship with China.", "text": "IT'S commonly believed that in order to demonstrate its Indian obsession, Washington seems to irrationally curtail its regional role in South Asia at a time when its global role has already been declining.

Those who support this notion often table the following grounds or arguments.\n\nDue to its policies in the Middle East and Latin America, America lost its soft power influence over other countries. At home, the state of permanent impasse in Congress is making it extremely difficult to make any progress in making decisions or reforming outdated and often counterproductive laws. Some even compare the United States with the British Empire, referring to its collapse a century ago. But, at the very least, this viewpoint suggests that America has lost the favour of many countries. Meanwhile, China has reached the status of a great power and globalization has become omnipresent. Stephen Walt, Belfer Professor of International Affairs at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, argues that 'the real issue is whether developments at home and overseas are making it harder for the United States to exercise the kind of dominant influence that it did for much of the later half of the 20th century.' According to this view, the United States is not declining and is still one of the most powerful countries in the world, but its capacity to lead global order has been diminished due to the array of domestic and foreign policy failures. The post Cold War international affairs culture endorses this truth.\n\nIn his book 'The China Choice', Hugh White fleshes this out with three arguments. First, 'as India emerges as a great power in its own right\u2026its aim will be to maximise its own power, not support America's.' Second, 'the stronger India becomes, the less it will need America to help balance China.' And third, 'the stronger China is relative to India, the more cautious Delhi will be about sacrificing its interest in a good relationship with Beijing.' To examine this emerging American-Indian geopolitical landscape , three factors determine the scope of this relationship: Firstly because they saw that benefits might accrue from being seen as valuable partners; secondly because the success and consequent emboldening of a regional hegemon would threaten them in the future; and thirdly, perhaps also because they had some commitment to, and interest in, basic norms of international conduct, such as preservation of the territorial status quo. It is not hard to see how each of these three dynamics could characterize a future Asian conflict. China's heft works both ways: it dissuades middle powers from exposing themselves to a US-China fight. India has a wide range of interests at stake in its relationship with China and India cannot afford to subordinate those interests to the concerns of America or Japan, or Australia.'\n\nThe first part may be partly true, but the second is less clear. India might well bandwagon in some areas becoming gradually more interoperable with the US, and balance in others, continuing to work at odds with Washington on, say, trade or climate change. Up to a point, one can indeed disaggregate these different economic/diplomatic and security/military elements. While many security and foreign policy analysts criticized US President Donald Trump's Afghanistan policy for lacking a clear-cut strategy, Trump's Afghanistan policy and Washington's obsession towards India has the potential to alter the geopolitical balance in the volatile region, thereby making peace incompatible with regional dynamics. It is logical to think that Pakistan considered India the main enemy, and knowing that the US wanted India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, it was logical that Islamabad would get closer to Beijing. 'Pakistani authorities think that cooperating with China would be more useful for them in this scenario than working with the US. China, too, is supporting Pakistan on all regional and international forums,' the expert underlined.\n\nNo wonder then, that there are renewed calls within the US to restore a workable relationship with Pakistan. As the conservative US think tank, Hudson Institute put it in a recent report. A New Approach to Pakistan, 'the Trump Administration should both publicly and privately maintain avenues for Pakistan to become a US ally, as well as trade and investment partner, in the future'.The latest developments show the new US strategy, which seeks a bigger role for Pakistan's archrival India in the conflict, would drag South Asia towards more peace chaos. Significantly, India's smaller South Asian neighbours are fast moving towards developing closer relationships with China. Although this is generally perceived as an anti-India phenomenon, the reality is that Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are looking up to China as a new guarantor of help in the face of the US' heavy-handed approach towards them.\n\nAntoine Levesques, IISS Research Associate for South Asia, expected China to play a more 'pro-active' role in Afghanistan into 2018, foremost diplomatically. But this posture would be conditioned by security developments in the country; details within, or any evolutions of, the US strategy's framework; the outcome of Trump's planned visit to Beijing; and China's willingness to take greater risks, including on promoting Afghan reconciliation. The real irony about Trump's segregating South Asia policy lies in Washington's blunt denial of seeking peace priorities as compared to its twisted perusal of strategic interests with India, thereby making US's fragile role in South Asian affairs.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [5, 21, 19, 14, 12, 23, 6, 13, 15, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 12, 21, 19, 4, 23, 6, 13], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [23, 12, 6, 5, 21, 19, 14, 4, 13], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [5, 21, 6, 12, 19, 14, 13, 4, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [5, 12, 6, 21, 19, 14, 15, 4, 13, 23], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Jamshedpur FC and Mumbai City FC have just two goals so far.\nSteve Coppell said he wasn't worried about playing conditions.\nThere have been complaints about the uneven pitch.\nGuimares said that there was immense respect for the way Jamshedpurwere organised.\nThe Cameroonian has scored one goal andprovided four assists in eight matches.\nEmana and Mumbai's top-scorer Balwant Singh will have to beat their best against a resilient side.", "text": "The battle of tactical supremacy is on thecards when two of stingiest defences of Hero Indian Super League'ssides Jamshedpur FC and Mumbai City FC will clash at the JRD TataSports Complex here tomorrow.Home side Jamshedpur FC have let in just two goals in sevenencounters, with Subrata Pal keeping five clean sheets in the process.As for Mumbai City, they have conceded seven goals - five of thesehave been away from home.

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" \n \nThis was passed in the wake of the Civil War, to ensure that slaves born in the United States were granted full citizenship, no matter the state laws. \n \nThat's also one reason the 14th Amendment has been a perennial obsession of white nationalists and right-wing militia groups, such as the sovereign citizen movement. \n \nBut rarely if ever has this wingnut argument made its way to the Oval Office. \n \nPlay to the base prejudice aside, the President cannot undo the Constitution. That's basic separation of powers stuff. \n \nThe President told Axios -- which seemed tipped off to ask the question by the White House in advance of the launch of its HBO special series -- that unnamed advisers had told him he could overturn birthright citizenship through the legislature or by executive order. \n \nThis is BS. No adviser with a passing understanding of the US government would seriously suggest this. Far more likely is that Trump was floating a trial balloon to change the national conversation and inflame the base. \n \nBut this trial balloon is particularly ironic given the conservative movement's obsession with Obama-era executive orders, which it loudly argued marked an assault on the Constitution, calling him \"King Obama\" -- and much worse. In contrast, they claimed to be \"constitutional conservatives\" -- faithful to the vision of the Founding Fathers. \n \nThere's nothing particularly wrong with executive orders -- George Washington and Thomas Jefferson used them and they ballooned under Republicans Ulysses S. Grant and Teddy Roosevelt. In fact, Barack Obama used fewer executive orders than his predecessors George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan -- though you'd never know it from watching Fox News during the last presidency. And then there's this: Trump is on pace to exceed the number of Obama executive orders if he serves two terms. (Obama issued an average of 35 executive orders a year. If Trump were to issue no more executive orders this year, his average would be 43 per year.) \n \nBut having raised the issue as a threat to the Constitution, it is absurd that Republicans are now ignoring or even encouraging the action because a president of their party is in power. Even more absurd is the fact that Trump has been issuing executive orders while Republicans have unified control of government. Such orders are most rationally used to overcome an obstructive opposition in Congress. \n \nAnother fundamental Trump mis-truth is the idea that birthright citizenship is unique to the United States. It's not. Canada and Mexico, and more than two dozen other countries, have similar statutes. \n \nVice President Mike Pence tried to support Trump when he said Tuesday, \"We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether or not the language of the 14th Amendment, 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally.\" \n \nBut Republican Rep. Justin Amash was right when he tweeted , \"A president cannot amend Constitution or laws via executive order. Concept of natural-born citizen in #14thAmendment derives from natural-born subject in Britain. Phrase 'and subject to the jurisdiction thereof' excludes mainly foreign diplomats, who are not subject to U.S. laws.\" \n \nSen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, made the point bipartisan: \"This notion that he can simply violate the Constitution by executive order, let's face it, no serious legal scholar thinks that's real.\" \n \nAs we've seen, some Trump defenders will point to \"anchor baby tourism\" as a problem in need of a solution. There are indeed properties that cater to this abuse of birthright citizenship. Trump should know -- his own Trump-branded properties in Florida are often advertised by third parties to expectant Russian parents, as The Daily Beast reported back in 2017 when I was editor-in-chief. Physician, heal thyself. And the President can start by cracking down on the practice through law enforcement rather than threatening to ignore the Constitution. \n \nBut just because the President can't unilaterally override the Constitution doesn't mean he won't try. He could sign an executive order, possibly against the legal advice of his Justice Department and immediately have the proposal blocked by suits from several states attorneys general. Because this isn't a jump ball, the issue will fail on the merits when it reaches the courts. \n \nBy then the President may have milked this for political benefit. So make no mistake -- this is play-to-the-base panic, a classic Trump attempt to distract and deflect.

Evidently, sexual deprivation is the largest reason that the lives of young children, boys and girls alike, are being ruined. So what's the fix? Who should we be protecting our kids from? Knowing how rapidly a disease like pedophilia is increasing in Pakistani society, and seeing how the police are least interested in these cases, who should the government appoint to control such an epidemic ? Should local authorities with power be more attentive to these cases? Should local schools be more articulate when explaining topics related to sex? Overall, the sexually frustrated people of this country need to control their urges. They shouldn't be assaulting kids or destroying their youthful sense of security, just to satisfy their own taboo needs. #Republic Of Pakistan\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [19, 23, 12, 6, 14, 13, 21, 4, 5], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [14, 6, 23, 13, 5, 4, 12, 21, 19], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [14, 13, 15, 21, 5, 6, 12, 4, 19, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [14, 19, 21, 4, 13, 6, 23, 5, 12, 15], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [13, 21, 19, 4, 14, 6, 23, 5, 15, 12], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Today, Microsoft's offering deep discounts on over 100 gaming laptops and desktop PCs.\nDell Inspiron 15 i5577-5858BLK-PUS for $600 ($200 discount): The GTX 1050 GPU in this more modest sibling of the above deal won't melt your face, but it's still PCWorld's pick for the best budget graphics card .\nAnd a gaming laptop for just $600?", "text": "Credit: IDG/Gordon Mah Ung  \nOn the seventh day of the Microsoft Store\u2019s annual 12 Days of Deals marathon, it\u2019s finally time to have some fun . Today, Microsoft\u2019s offering deep discounts on over 100 gaming laptops and desktop PCs. \n \nSome truly staggering deals are already out of stock as I write this around 8:30 A.M. Eastern, and it\u2019s easy to see why\u2014they paired potent gaming PCs with Windows Mixed Reality headsets for $500 to $650 off. But plenty of systems can still be found with discounts ranging from $100 to $600 or more depending on the PC and its configuration. As PCWorld\u2019s resident gaming and graphics guru, here are some particularly juicy deals that caught my eye: \n Dell Inspiron 15 7577 i7577-5258BLK-PUS for $899 ($200 discount): You don\u2019t find laptops with a GeForce GTX 1060 graphics chip selling for under $1,000 very often.  Dell Inspiron 15 i5577-5858BLK-PUS for $600 ($200 discount): The GTX 1050 GPU in this more modest sibling of the above deal won\u2019t melt your face, but it\u2019s still PCWorld\u2019s pick for the best budget graphics card . And a gaming laptop for just $600? Snag it while you can.  Alienware 17 R4 AW17R4-7004SLV-PUS for $1,899 ($600 discount): Okay, this discount isn\u2019t as steep as Microsoft claims, as you can find this notebook selling for $2,169 at other e-tailers. But it\u2019s still a solid deal on the Alienware 17 R4 , PCWorld\u2019s favorite 17-inch gaming laptop .  Asus ROG Zephyrus GX501VI-US74 for $2,499 ($200 discount): And here\u2019s our favorite 15.6-inch gaming laptop going for a solid $200 off mere months after launch. The stunning ROG Zephyrus uses Nvidia\u2019s Max-Q technology to cram the GTX 1080\u2019s power into an incredibly thin and light notebook, bolstered by a luscious 120Hz G-Sync display. The battery life stinks though.   IDG / Adam Patrick Murray  MSI Trident 3 VR7RC-028US Signature Edition for $849 ($150 discount): Core i5, a GTX 1060, and a 1TB hard drive paired with a 128GB SSD is a solid deal for this price\u2014doubly so when it comes in a console-sized case that\u2019s surprisingly quiet. We just reviewed a more potent version of the Trident 3 and fell in love with it.  Alienware 15 R3 AW15R3-7003SLV-PUS for $1,599 ($600 discount): Now\u2019s the time to buy an Alienware laptop, it seems. The Alienware 15 R3 just earned a 4 out of 5 star rating in a PCWorld review, and that was at its full $2,199 price. This beast delivers desktop-class firepower in a case you can tuck into your backpack.  Razer DeathAdder Elite for $50 ($20 discount): The DeathAdder Elite is one of the most popular gaming mice in the world, and for good reason: You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a better mouse for first-person shooters. But the DeathAdder\u2019s shape feels divine in your hand even for office tasks. It\u2019s my personal go-to mouse, and the Elite version never sells for anything cheaper than this. Lots of other Razer keyboards and mice are on sale, too.  Dell 28 Ultra HD 4K Monitor - S2817Q for $399 ($230 discount): Dell makes damned fine monitors. Damned fine 4K monitors are almost impossible to find for less than $500. Snatch this up if you\u2019ve been looking to upgrade your display to ultra HD. Gamers take note: This monitor does not feature G-Sync or FreeSync technology .  Lenovo Y gaming mouse mat for $5 ($5 discount): I haven\u2019t touched this, but it\u2019s a microfiber gaming mouse mat for just $5. Why not chuck it in the cart and give it a try if you\u2019re buying something else too?  \nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. There are 118 gaming PC and PC peripheral deals in total on Microsoft\u2019s seventh day of deals, so head on over and take a peek even if none of the ones above strike your fancy. Be warned: Several of the desktop deals feature older 6th-gen Intel Core processors. They\u2019ll still do just fine for gaming\u2014especially in a configuration like this beastly HP Omen desktop \u2014but note that we\u2019re up to 8th generation Core chips now.

He is the stubborn mule who, after contracting motor neurone disease, refused to sit back from his ambitions as a film-maker and, assisted by friends and technology, directed the accomplished feature My Name is Emily . Clearly a man with a restless brain, Fitzmaurice \u2013 relying on an eye-gaze computer \u2013 also completed a memoir of his illness titled It\u2019s Not Yet Dark . Now it has become a moving, lively documentary. He\u2019s an example to us all. \n\nWithout imposing any gimmicks, director Frankie Fenton , an experienced television professional, has brought visual variety to his largely chronological retelling of an often-appalling story. He incorporates gorgeous mobile shots of the Irish countryside. A visit to Australia following diagnosis allows sunlight into a story that is already starting to close in upon the viewer. For a picture that has much to do with depletion, It\u2019s Not Yet Dark buzzes with all the right sorts of energy. \n \nTop talent fleshes out the credits and adds class to the package. Colin Farrell speaks Fitzmaurice\u2019s words with a mellifluousness that never dips into the melodramatic. Stephen Rennicks , frequent collaborator with Lenny Abrahamson, delivers an effective, unobtrusive score. \n  \n[embedded content] \n  An ordinary upbringing  \nAfter an introduction that lays out the complications of Fitzmaurice\u2019s condition \u2013 paralysed from the neck down, he breathes via respirator and communicates with a voice simulator \u2013 we drift back to hear about an ordinary middle-class upbringing. He was smart but he didn\u2019t try very hard at school. He and his dad loved watching classic cinema together. The most important voice, aside from that of the narrator, belongs to Ruth Fitzmaurice , Simon\u2019s wife (now an acclaimed author of a revelatory memoir). Early on she reveals that, in their first meetings, Simon came across as an arrogant jerk. She soon softened to him, but that initial impression hints at a strength of personality that will serve him well when the illness strikes. \n \nRuth relates the many hardships they were to face, but she is not allowed (or does not allow herself) to wallow in any sort of self-pity. The sense throughout is of a relentless drive forward. Halt and the earth might swallow them up. \n \nFollowing college and film school, Fitzmaurice directed a fine short that took him to the Sundance Film Festival. While walking the streets of Park City, Utah, a stubborn pain in his foot continued to nag. Nobody thought anything much of it. But a doctor eventually diagnosed the same disease that has clawed away at Stephen Hawking. \n Arctic explorer\u2019s beard  \nArchive footage leads towards a destination with which we are already familiar. Now wrapped in a sturdy, Arctic explorer\u2019s beard, Simon relies upon dedicated staff to keep him aloft. The film is good on the logistical and aesthetic details of that care. Ruth and Simon considered changing the American-tinged vowels of his voice simulator, but, by that stage, they reckoned it had become an immovable part of his personality. A visiting boffin explains how the technology functions. Later still, we get fascinating insights into how \u2013 making much use of storyboards and the admirable Liz Gill as support director \u2013 he managed to stay in control of My Name is Emily on set. \n \nThere is much wisdom in Fitzmaurice\u2019s text. (\u201cThe best part of living with MND is living,\u201d he wryly notes). As was the case with My Name is Emily , there are also, for this critic\u2019s taste, a few too many outbreaks of borderline-New Age inspirational sloganeering. Mind you, if any person should be indulged in that regard it is Simon Fitzmaurice.

This week, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet announced it would be setting up 12 regional offices to issue the special licenses that will allow Kentuckians to board domestic flights and gain access to certain federal facilities. \u00a0 \n\nFor folks in Calloway County, a trek to Paducah will be necessary if they wish to attain a voluntary travel ID. Calloway County Circuit Court Clerk Linda Avery said that is an option for those who wish to get their voluntary travel ID, but added that many Calloway County natives could make do with a passport, should they so choose. \u00a0 \n\n\u201cWhat I have come to realize in this period of time is that not everybody needs a Real ID,\u201d Avery said. \u201cIf you have a passport, you don\u2019t have to have the voluntary travel ID on your driver\u2019s license.

For those people, the option to get a voluntary travel ID will still be present at the office in Paducah. \u00a0 \n\nAvery said that the Paducah office should be open after the beginning of 2020, though a concrete date is not yet in place. Avery said the new system is also in a state of transition, and that the procedures for getting a passport have been set in place for a while. \u00a0 \n\n\u201cThe passport process has been honed to perfection over the years by federal government,\u201d Avery said. \u201cIt will probably be less frustrating for people to go through that process, especially since the library is now a passport acceptance facility.\u201d \u00a0 \n \nThe regional offices are needed to beat an Oct. 1, 2020, federal deadline for the state to start issuing Real ID driver\u2019s licenses within the state. While the state originally planned to have circuit court clerks across Kentucky\u2019s 120 counties handle the process, staffing issues and other factors involved in the pilot programs in Franklin and Woodford counties saw the state move to the regional office option. \u00a0 \n\nAccording to the Lexington Herald-Leader, Matt Henderson, vehicle regulation commissioner in the state Transportation Cabinet, told state lawmakers Monday that the state eventually would like to have 28 to 30 regional offices. \n\nThe cost to operate and staff 28 regional offices, he said, would be about $16 million a year, but the sale of the special licenses would help defray the expenses. The licenses will cost $24 for four years and $48 for eight years. \n\nWhile the new IDs are mostly for the state to come into compliance with federal law, Avery said that for anyone in Calloway County who doesn\u2019t have plans to board a plane or visit a federal facility, a standard driver\u2019s license should suffice for their needs.

Every week there are more shops closing down, there are more people losing jobs and there seems to be nothing coming in to improve the situation,\u201d said Laura Hamilton, the driving force behind the project. \u201cOne thing that Dumfries is desperate for is leisure activities which suit all ages, no just specific to one age range. If families want to go for a family day, they have to travel out of the town, with most decent activities being in Carlisle, Ayr or Glasgow.\u201d \n \nHamilton\u2019s ambition, however, has proven someway above her budget. \n \n\u201cWe did originally plan for the centre to be a privately owned business, however after all our consultations, surveys and costings, we are looking at a total cost of around \u00a31.4m, which is way over our planned budget,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe problem with opening it as a privately owned business is that we would need to take out extensive loans to be able to afford the entire construction and launch of the business. This would also mean we would need to charge a lot more for entrance fees to the centre, which may mean that some residents may not be able to afford regular use of the facility, which really makes the entire project pointless, as this is here for all the community, not just the few.\u201d \n \nAs such, Hamilton has now decided to launch the centre as a not-for-profit community business which will be owned, operated and run by the community, for the community. \n \n\u201cBy launching the place as a not-for-profit, this means we will have access to a large range of funding and grants, we will not need to take out extensive loans, all income will be reinvested into the business, we will be able to charge much less for entry fees and the business will be managed by a board, for the benefit of the community, not for the benefit of one person\u2019s profits.\u201d \n \nFeasibility studies, market research, consultations, property and land surveys, as well as meetings with designers and tours of similar projects have already taken place. The next step will be to draw up official plans, apply for planning permission and funding and develop a board to over-see the future of the facility. However, with only a \u00a31,500 budget left, Hamilton will need significant investment for her FEC dreams to become reality. \n \n \nShare this article"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [6, 5, 4, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 19], "scores": [0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [23, 4, 14, 21, 12, 6, 5, 19, 13], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 21, 14, 5, 6, 12, 23, 4], "scores": [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 13, 5, 12, 19, 21, 4, 23, 14], "scores": [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 4, 21, 14, 13, 15, 12, 23, 19, 6, 5], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Allice Ah Fa, 20, died by suicide at a Sydney university.\nHe was allegedly trying to stab a neighbour in Minto.\nTributes have poured in for the young man following a Daily Mail Australia story.\nWestern Sydney University closed its gym on Monday.\nPolice said the incident was deemed not suspicious.", "text": "Allice Ah Fa mourned by loved ones following Western Sydney University death\n\nThe 20-year-old was a hero in an alleged terror attack in September 2016\u00a0\n\nHe and his relatives were publicly recognised for their brave intervention\u00a0\n\n'It's very hard, everybody's shocked in our community,' his uncle Sivei said\u00a0\n\nMr Ahfa was studying to become a police officer at the university\u00a0\n\nFor confidential support call the Lifeline 24-hour crisis support on 13 11 14\u00a0 The young stabbing attack hero who died by suicide at a Sydney  university left a note before his death.\u00a0\n\nBut Allice Ah Fa's family said they still do not know why the aspiring police officer, 20, tragically ended his life at Western Sydney University this week.\u00a0\n\nMr Ah Fa's father dropped his shy and quiet son at the train station on Monday morning.\u00a0\n\n'That's my last scene, 'see you', 'bye',' Tanielu Ah Fa told Daily Mail Australia.\u00a0\n\n'I never seen anything happening to him, or worry, there's no worry on his face.'\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHis boy didn't come home that night.

He talks proudly about once high-fiving Rudy Ruettiger, the former Notre Dame walk-on famous for sacking a quarterback during the final seconds of the only game of his college career. Mr. Ruettiger\u2019s story was the basis of the 1993 movie \u201cRudy.\u201d\n\nIt is no coincidence that Mr. Mulroy\u2019s Shih Tzu is named Rudy.\n\nIt is no wonder that Mr. Mulroy\u2019s wife, Linda, says, \u201cI feel like my whole world revolves around Notre Dame.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Mulroy never graduated from Notre Dame. He did not even attend Notre Dame.\n\nMr. Mulroy, a retired New York City police detective, is what Notre Dame calls a \u201csubway alum,\u201d someone who roots for Notre Dame but does not have a Notre Dame diploma. The term \u201csubway alums\u201d was coined a century ago, when Notre Dame played some away games in New York. Now Notre Dame uses the term for people who aren\u2019t graduates of the school but are involved in alumni affairs nationally, including those in places that do not have subways.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame Club of Staten Island has 43 members who graduated from the school, \u201cbut our total membership is over 160 because of guys like me\u201d and parents of undergraduates, said Joseph Delaney, a former club president who graduated in 1967 from Seton Hall University, which has not had a varsity football team since 1981.\n\nNotre Dame\u2019s president, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, said fans who didn\u2019t graduate from the school but who go to Notre Dame tailgate parties and games, collect Notre Dame memorabilia and conduct community service projects are \u201cunique.\u201d Subway alums are so important to the school that Mr. Delaney was recently named the first non-alumnus on Notre Dame\u2019s alumni board of directors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen schools like Texas or Michigan that are larger and nationally known that have fan bases,\u201d Chase Carter, president of the Council of Alumni Marketing and Membership Professionals who is also an official at Oklahoma State University\u2019s alumni association, said. \u201cBut nothing like this.\u201d\n\nThe rise of the subway alums coincided with Notre Dame\u2019s desire for its football team to be recognized nationally, which is why it scheduled games in New York.\n\nBut there was more to Notre Dame during that era than football. The team\u2019s fame \u201ccoincided with the immigrant wave and an anti-immigrant attitude and a little bit of anti-Catholic attitude,\u201d Father Jenkins said. \u201cIt became the team of this immigrant population, this group that was new to this country.\u201d Also, he added, \u201cNotre Dame scored a few stunning upsets. That helped.\u201d\n\nFather Jenkins said his father hooked him on watching Notre Dame games when he was growing up in Wisconsin. \u201cIt became your identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYour teams when you\u2019re 13 are the teams you root for, for life. It\u2019s associated with memory, family, coming together. It has this resonance that goes beyond the sport.\u201d\n\nFor many around the country, Notre Dame represented something bigger than a school or a team. \u201cMy dad was an Irish-Catholic blue collar man who took great pride in what Notre Dame stood for,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cIt was a matter of pride to my dad that the football players graduated, became doctors, became lawyers and some of them became clergy, but Notre Dame football gave them entry into the American mainstream. Guys like my dad who didn\u2019t go to college identified with that.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulroy \u2014 who graduated from The College of Staten Island \u2014 said he\u2019d often put the Notre Dame game on the radio during his police shift. \"In between calls, in between any situations, you always had the Notre Dame game on,\u201d he said.\n\nOnce, he and his partner, while off duty, went to a Giants-Jets game and heard the Notre Dame fight song among the tailgaters in the parking lot. The two ended up joining the tailgate and were introduced to Joe Nagy, the sheriff of St. Joseph County, Ind., home to Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cHe was introduced to us as the sheriff of Notre Dame,\u201d Mr. Mulroy said. \u201cI said, \u2018Sure, you\u2019re the sheriff of Notre Dame like I\u2019m the sheriff of Nottingham Forest.\u2019\u201d They became fast friends.\n\nNew York has produced more than subway alums for Notre Dame, of course. \u201cThe first-ever Notre Dame Heisman Trophy candidate was from Staten Island,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cWilliam Shakespeare. I kid you not. Notre Dame\u2019s quarterback in 1935. He finished third in the Heisman Trophy. And you know what?

The P25 CAP AP holds quarterly meetings with the public on topics related to P25 CAP. The next meeting is scheduled for the October 2018 timeframe.\n\nDATES:\n\nAll responses must be received by October 31, 2018 at the address listed below. ADDRESSES: Expressions of interest and nominations shall be submitted to P25CAP@hq.dhs.gov\n\nInstructions: All submissions received must include the words \"Department of Homeland Security\" and DHS-2018-0051.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sridhar Kowdley, Program Manager, Office for Interoperability and Compatibility, Science and Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security, 202-254-8804, Sridhar.Kowdley@hq.dhs.gov\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground P25 is a standards development process for the design, manufacture, and evaluation of interoperable digital two-way land mobile radio communications products created by and for public safety professionals. The goal of P25 is to specify formal standards for interfaces and features between the various components of a land mobile radio system commonly used by public safety agencies in portable handheld and mobile vehicle-mounted devices. The P25 standard enables interoperability among different suppliers' products.\n\nP25 CAP was developed by DHS to test equipment designed to comply with P25 standards. P25 CAP ensures that communications equipment that is declared by the supplier to be P25-compliant, in fact, is tested against the standards with publicly published results. The program provides public safety agencies with evidence that the communications equipment they are purchasing is tested against and complies with the P25 standards for performance, conformance, and interoperability. The P25 CAP AP provides a resource by which DHS gains insight into the collective interest of organizations that procure P25-compliant equipment and a resource for DHS to continue to establish the policies of the P25 CAP, along with assisting the DHS Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) in the administration of the program.\n\nP25 CAP is a voluntary program that provides a mechanism for the recognition of testing laboratories based on internationally accepted standards. It identifies competent P25 CAP testing laboratories for DHS-recognition through a robust assessment process and promotes the acceptance of compliant test results from these laboratories.\n\nAs a voluntary program, P25 CAP allows suppliers to publicly attest to their products' compliance with a selected group of requirements through Summary Test Report (STR) and Supplier's Declaration of Compliance (SDOC) documents based on the Detailed Test Report (DTR) from the DHS-recognized laboratory(ies) that performed the product testing. In turn, DHS makes these documents available to the first response community to inform their purchasing decisions via the dhs.gov/science-and-technology/p25-cap website.\n\nMembership\n\nThe Science and Technology Directorate (SandT) of DHS formed the P25 CAP AP to provide SandT with the views of active local, state, tribal, territorial and Federal government officials who use or whose offices use portable handheld and mobile vehicle-mounted radios. Those government officials selected to participate in the P25 CAP AP are selected based on their experience with the management and procurement of land mobile radio systems or knowledge of conformity assessment programs and methods. The OIC selection process balances viewpoints required to effectively address P25 CAP issues under consideration. To fill one open position on the P25 CAP AP, OIC is particularly interested in receiving nominations and expressions of interest from individuals in the following categories:\n\n* State, tribal, territorial, or local government agencies and organizations with expertise in communications issues and technologies.\n\n* Federal government agencies with expertise in communications or homeland security matters.\n\nWhile OIC can call for a meeting of the P25 CAP AP as it deems necessary and appropriate, for member commitment and planning purposes, it is anticipated that the P25 CAP AP will meet approximately 3-4 times annually in their role of providing guidance and support to the P25 CAP.\n\nThose selected to serve on the P25 CAP AP will be required to sign a gratuitous services agreement and will not be paid or reimbursed for their participation; however, DHS SandT will, subject to the availability of funds, reimburse the travel expenses associated with the participation of non-Federal members in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. OIC reserves the right to select primary and alternate members to the P25 CAP AP for terms appropriate for the accomplishment of the Board's mission. Members serve at the pleasure of the OIC Director.\n\nRegistered lobbyists pursuant to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 are not eligible for membership on the P25 CAP AP and will not be considered.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nThe duties of the P25 CAP AP will include providing recommendations of its individual members to OIC regarding actions and steps OIC could take to promote the P25 CAP. The duties of the P25 CAP AP may include but are not limited to its members reviewing, commenting on, and advising on:\n\na. The laboratory component of the P25 CAP under established, documented laboratory recognition guidelines.\n\nb. Proposed Compliance Assessment Bulletins (CABs).\n\nc. Proposed updates to previously approved CABs, as Notices of Proposed CABs, to enable comment and input on the proposed CAB modifications.\n\nd. OIC updates to existing test documents or establishing new test documents for new types of P25 equipment.\n\ne. Best practices associated with improvement of the policies and procedures by which the P25 CAP operates.\n\nf. Existing test documents including but not limited to SDOCs and STRs posted on the dhs.gov/science-and-technology/p25-cap website.\n\ng. Proposed P25 user input for improving functionality through the standards-making process.\n\nNominations/Expressions of Interest Procedures and Deadline\n\nNominations and expressions of interest shall be received by OIC no later than October 31, 2018 at the address P25CAP@hq.dhs.gov Nominations and expressions of interest received after this date shall not be considered.

That's what he did by developing 3D-printed bandages. For more information see the IDTechEx report on 3D printing materials .  \nGerstenhaber, a bioengineering professor, along with the help of other engineering faculty and students, created a 3D printer that uses electrospinning technology to print bandages directly onto a patient's skin, making them fit the individual's physical form. \n \nElectrospinning technology is a production method used to make polymer fiber, which is a synthetic material. \n \nOn March 25, Gerstenhaber presented a demonstration of the prototype \u2014 which consists of a larger robotic piece made from additional 3D-printed components \u2014 at The Franklin Institute. \n \nGerstenhaber drew inspiration from a presentation made by Peter Lelkes, the bioengineering department chair, while he was pursuing his Ph.D. in bioengineering at Temple last year. He said Lelkes' work focused on bone regeneration using fabrics made from cytosine, one of the bases found in DNA. \n \n\"What he found was that suddenly he had an ability to lay these fabrics on holes drilled in skulls of mice, and they could heal them,\" Gerstenhaber said. \"(The holes were) big enough that they wouldn't (normally) heal on a mouse.\" \n  \nWhen Gerstenhaber saw the presentation, he started to think about individualizing dental and jaw implants, many of which are standardized. \n \n\"All of their implants were either flat, or perfectly round, something they could do without having a complicated robot do it for them because they were limited,\" Gerstenhaber said. \"(Prosthetic companies) couldn't make any realistic examples of any of these use scenarios because the tools didn't exist.\" \n \n\u00a0 \n \nBranching off from Lelkes' project, Gerstenhaber wanted to develop a flexible bandage for serious wounds that would not only stop bleeding, but also quickly regenerate the skin. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\"I was like, 'Wow, I'm making this tool to make my life easier, but it's going to open this whole new avenue of research,'\" Gerstenhaber said. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nHis bandages are made with a soy protein, which helps tissue heal faster than it would if covered by a conventional bandage. The technique is being researched in labs within the College of Engineering. The participating scientists are testing the bandages to ensure they have the capability of helping external tissue regenerate. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWhen applied with water, the white bandages adhere to the skin in an almost invisible fashion.

It\u2019s a universal health care system largely financed by government national health insurance. It\u2019s free and consistently ranks among the best ones in the world, despite the average spending being way below that of the US.\n\nOf course, the system is not perfect. For instance, one thing which medical scientists have long objected to is the reimbursement of homeopathic costs.\n\nFrance has a long history with homeopathy, this being the most popular alternative treatment. Its prevalence rose steadily since the 1980s, despite the fact that research has consistently shown that there is no reliable evidence to support homeopathic products (read our in-depth explanation of why homeopathy sometimes seems to work here).

According to official figures, French social security in 2018 paid back patients some 126.8 million euros ($142.2 million) for homeopathic treatment \u2014 out of a total of 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) refunded for medicines in total.\n\nThat will now stop.\n\nUnlike conventional treatments, which can be fully reimbursed by the government, the reimbursement of homeopathic products is currently limited at 30% of the price. French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said the reimbursement will be gradually phased out, going down to 15% in 2020 and 0% in 2021.\n\nBuzyn, a leading French hematologist and university professor, had no previous experience in politics before joining the government in 2017. She has consistently emphasized the importance of implementing science-based policies, even if the decisions are unpopular \u2014 which is the case here.\n\nThe decision was met with substantial backlash from a part of the French population, which considered it a breach of their individual freedom. However, Buzyn emphasizes that doctors will still be free to prescribe homeopathic treatments, and people are still free to buy them if they so choose. Still, in order for the government to offer reimbursements, there needs to be some evidence supporting homeopathy \u2014 which, at the moment, isn\u2019t the case. In fact, the principles behind homeopathy have long been disproven.\n\nIt\u2019s a small but significant step for a country where homeopathy is very prevalent.

Just like cancer, diabetes cannot be seen and in many cases have been developing and growing in your body for years without detection. Most people treat diabetes as a mild illness and fail to take care of it until it\u2019s too late. Thus often the two diseases are called \u2018silent killers\u2019. \u2018The two diseases also share certain risk factors, of which we cannot control certain factors such as age, family history and ethnicity, others are still manageable. Risk factors like obesity, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet and smoking also make you vulnerable to diseases and these can be controlled through well-timed intervention,\u2019 Dr Roshani Gadge, Consultant Diabetologist, Gadge Diabetes Center, Mumbai. \n\n\u2018An association between diabetes and cancer has been talked about for several years, but it is only in the recent past (about 10 years) that significant evidence has established the link between the two and has proved that insulin plays a crucial role here,\u2019 she opines. \n \nWhat makes us prone to diabetes? \n \nDr Roshni says, \u2018Almost 56 percent of our calories come from three sources that were non-existent when our genes were developing: \n Refined sugars (cane and beet sugar, corn, syrup, fructose, etc)  Bleached flour (white bread, white pasts, white rice, etc)  Vegetable oils (soybean, sunflower, corn, trans fats)  \nIt so happens that these three sources contain none of the proteins, vitamins, or omega-3 fatty acids needed to keep our bodies functioning. On the other hand, they directly fuel the growth of cancer. When we eat sugar or white flour \u2013 foods with a high glycemic index \u2013 blood glucose levels rise rapidly. The body immediately releases a dose of insulin to enable the glucose to enter cells. The secretion of insulin is accompanied by the release of another molecule called IGF (insulin-like growth factor) whose role is to stimulate cell growth. In short, sugar nourishes tissues and makes them grow faster. Furthermore, insulin and IGF have another effect in common: they promote the factors of inflammation which also stimulates cell growth and acts as a fertilizer for tumours to grow. \n \nThere is a good reason to believe the sugar rise in the blood contributes to the cancer epidemic, as it is linked to an explosion of insulin and IGF in our bodies. \n \nThe link between type II diabetes and risk of cancer \n \nIn case of type II diabetes, the body cannot make efficient use of the insulin \u2013 a condition known as insulin resistance. To compensate, the pancreas speeds up the production of insulin in your body. Consequently, insulin begins to build up in your bloodstream, which causes cells to divide, grow and spread \u2013 this may include cancerous cells, leading to the growth of a tumour. Those with Type 1 Diabetes have no insulin production at all and depend on artificially injected insulin, which can be more precisely controlled. \n \nStudies suggest that people with Diabetes (primarily Type 2) are associated with an increased risk of some cancers such as liver, pancreas, colon/rectum, breast and bladder cancers. Therefore, it is very important that you monitor and keep your blood sugar levels regulated. On the other hand, diabetes is also associated with a reduced risk for prostate cancer, some good news for men! \n \nImage source: Shutterstock \n Published: January 22, 2018 9"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [13, 23, 6, 19, 5, 21, 12, 4, 14], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 14, 6, 13, 23, 21, 5, 12, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [19, 4, 6, 23, 13, 14, 5, 12, 21], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [23, 6, 12, 5, 21, 13, 14, 19, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [19, 15, 14, 13, 4, 23, 6, 12, 5, 21, 15], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking nominations and expressions of interest for filling one open position on the Project 25 (P25) Compliance Assessment Program (CAP) Advisory Panel (AP).\nThe P25 CAP AP provides a resource by which DHS gains insight into the collective interest of organizations that procure P25-compliant equipment and a resource for DHS to continue to establish the policies of the P25 CAP, along with assisting the DHS Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) in the administration of the program.", "text": "Agency: \"Science and Technology Directorate, DHS.\"\n\nSUMMARY: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking nominations and expressions of interest for filling one open position on the Project 25 (P25) Compliance Assessment Program (CAP) Advisory Panel (AP).

The goal of P25 is to specify formal standards for interfaces and features between the various components of a land mobile radio system commonly used by public safety agencies in portable handheld and mobile vehicle-mounted devices. The P25 standard enables interoperability among different suppliers' products.\n\nP25 CAP was developed by DHS to test equipment designed to comply with P25 standards. P25 CAP ensures that communications equipment that is declared by the supplier to be P25-compliant, in fact, is tested against the standards with publicly published results. The program provides public safety agencies with evidence that the communications equipment they are purchasing is tested against and complies with the P25 standards for performance, conformance, and interoperability. The P25 CAP AP provides a resource by which DHS gains insight into the collective interest of organizations that procure P25-compliant equipment and a resource for DHS to continue to establish the policies of the P25 CAP, along with assisting the DHS Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) in the administration of the program.\n\nP25 CAP is a voluntary program that provides a mechanism for the recognition of testing laboratories based on internationally accepted standards. It identifies competent P25 CAP testing laboratories for DHS-recognition through a robust assessment process and promotes the acceptance of compliant test results from these laboratories.\n\nAs a voluntary program, P25 CAP allows suppliers to publicly attest to their products' compliance with a selected group of requirements through Summary Test Report (STR) and Supplier's Declaration of Compliance (SDOC) documents based on the Detailed Test Report (DTR) from the DHS-recognized laboratory(ies) that performed the product testing. In turn, DHS makes these documents available to the first response community to inform their purchasing decisions via the dhs.gov/science-and-technology/p25-cap website.\n\nMembership\n\nThe Science and Technology Directorate (SandT) of DHS formed the P25 CAP AP to provide SandT with the views of active local, state, tribal, territorial and Federal government officials who use or whose offices use portable handheld and mobile vehicle-mounted radios. Those government officials selected to participate in the P25 CAP AP are selected based on their experience with the management and procurement of land mobile radio systems or knowledge of conformity assessment programs and methods. The OIC selection process balances viewpoints required to effectively address P25 CAP issues under consideration. To fill one open position on the P25 CAP AP, OIC is particularly interested in receiving nominations and expressions of interest from individuals in the following categories:\n\n* State, tribal, territorial, or local government agencies and organizations with expertise in communications issues and technologies.\n\n* Federal government agencies with expertise in communications or homeland security matters.\n\nWhile OIC can call for a meeting of the P25 CAP AP as it deems necessary and appropriate, for member commitment and planning purposes, it is anticipated that the P25 CAP AP will meet approximately 3-4 times annually in their role of providing guidance and support to the P25 CAP.\n\nThose selected to serve on the P25 CAP AP will be required to sign a gratuitous services agreement and will not be paid or reimbursed for their participation; however, DHS SandT will, subject to the availability of funds, reimburse the travel expenses associated with the participation of non-Federal members in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. OIC reserves the right to select primary and alternate members to the P25 CAP AP for terms appropriate for the accomplishment of the Board's mission. Members serve at the pleasure of the OIC Director.\n\nRegistered lobbyists pursuant to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 are not eligible for membership on the P25 CAP AP and will not be considered.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nThe duties of the P25 CAP AP will include providing recommendations of its individual members to OIC regarding actions and steps OIC could take to promote the P25 CAP. The duties of the P25 CAP AP may include but are not limited to its members reviewing, commenting on, and advising on:\n\na. The laboratory component of the P25 CAP under established, documented laboratory recognition guidelines.\n\nb. Proposed Compliance Assessment Bulletins (CABs).\n\nc.

Its prevalence rose steadily since the 1980s, despite the fact that research has consistently shown that there is no reliable evidence to support homeopathic products (read our in-depth explanation of why homeopathy sometimes seems to work here).

According to official figures, French social security in 2018 paid back patients some 126.8 million euros ($142.2 million) for homeopathic treatment \u2014 out of a total of 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) refunded for medicines in total.\n\nThat will now stop.\n\nUnlike conventional treatments, which can be fully reimbursed by the government, the reimbursement of homeopathic products is currently limited at 30% of the price. French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said the reimbursement will be gradually phased out, going down to 15% in 2020 and 0% in 2021.\n\nBuzyn, a leading French hematologist and university professor, had no previous experience in politics before joining the government in 2017. She has consistently emphasized the importance of implementing science-based policies, even if the decisions are unpopular \u2014 which is the case here.\n\nThe decision was met with substantial backlash from a part of the French population, which considered it a breach of their individual freedom. However, Buzyn emphasizes that doctors will still be free to prescribe homeopathic treatments, and people are still free to buy them if they so choose. Still, in order for the government to offer reimbursements, there needs to be some evidence supporting homeopathy \u2014 which, at the moment, isn\u2019t the case. In fact, the principles behind homeopathy have long been disproven.\n\nIt\u2019s a small but significant step for a country where homeopathy is very prevalent.

The next meeting is scheduled for the October 2018 timeframe.\n\nDATES:\n\nAll responses must be received by October 31, 2018 at the address listed below. ADDRESSES: Expressions of interest and nominations shall be submitted to P25CAP@hq.dhs.gov\n\nInstructions: All submissions received must include the words \"Department of Homeland Security\" and DHS-2018-0051.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sridhar Kowdley, Program Manager, Office for Interoperability and Compatibility, Science and Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security, 202-254-8804, Sridhar.Kowdley@hq.dhs.gov\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground P25 is a standards development process for the design, manufacture, and evaluation of interoperable digital two-way land mobile radio communications products created by and for public safety professionals. The goal of P25 is to specify formal standards for interfaces and features between the various components of a land mobile radio system commonly used by public safety agencies in portable handheld and mobile vehicle-mounted devices. The P25 standard enables interoperability among different suppliers' products.\n\nP25 CAP was developed by DHS to test equipment designed to comply with P25 standards. P25 CAP ensures that communications equipment that is declared by the supplier to be P25-compliant, in fact, is tested against the standards with publicly published results. The program provides public safety agencies with evidence that the communications equipment they are purchasing is tested against and complies with the P25 standards for performance, conformance, and interoperability. The P25 CAP AP provides a resource by which DHS gains insight into the collective interest of organizations that procure P25-compliant equipment and a resource for DHS to continue to establish the policies of the P25 CAP, along with assisting the DHS Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) in the administration of the program.\n\nP25 CAP is a voluntary program that provides a mechanism for the recognition of testing laboratories based on internationally accepted standards. It identifies competent P25 CAP testing laboratories for DHS-recognition through a robust assessment process and promotes the acceptance of compliant test results from these laboratories.\n\nAs a voluntary program, P25 CAP allows suppliers to publicly attest to their products' compliance with a selected group of requirements through Summary Test Report (STR) and Supplier's Declaration of Compliance (SDOC) documents based on the Detailed Test Report (DTR) from the DHS-recognized laboratory(ies) that performed the product testing. In turn, DHS makes these documents available to the first response community to inform their purchasing decisions via the dhs.gov/science-and-technology/p25-cap website.\n\nMembership\n\nThe Science and Technology Directorate (SandT) of DHS formed the P25 CAP AP to provide SandT with the views of active local, state, tribal, territorial and Federal government officials who use or whose offices use portable handheld and mobile vehicle-mounted radios. Those government officials selected to participate in the P25 CAP AP are selected based on their experience with the management and procurement of land mobile radio systems or knowledge of conformity assessment programs and methods. The OIC selection process balances viewpoints required to effectively address P25 CAP issues under consideration. To fill one open position on the P25 CAP AP, OIC is particularly interested in receiving nominations and expressions of interest from individuals in the following categories:\n\n* State, tribal, territorial, or local government agencies and organizations with expertise in communications issues and technologies.\n\n* Federal government agencies with expertise in communications or homeland security matters.\n\nWhile OIC can call for a meeting of the P25 CAP AP as it deems necessary and appropriate, for member commitment and planning purposes, it is anticipated that the P25 CAP AP will meet approximately 3-4 times annually in their role of providing guidance and support to the P25 CAP.\n\nThose selected to serve on the P25 CAP AP will be required to sign a gratuitous services agreement and will not be paid or reimbursed for their participation; however, DHS SandT will, subject to the availability of funds, reimburse the travel expenses associated with the participation of non-Federal members in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. OIC reserves the right to select primary and alternate members to the P25 CAP AP for terms appropriate for the accomplishment of the Board's mission. Members serve at the pleasure of the OIC Director.\n\nRegistered lobbyists pursuant to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 are not eligible for membership on the P25 CAP AP and will not be considered.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nThe duties of the P25 CAP AP will include providing recommendations of its individual members to OIC regarding actions and steps OIC could take to promote the P25 CAP. The duties of the P25 CAP AP may include but are not limited to its members reviewing, commenting on, and advising on:\n\na. The laboratory component of the P25 CAP under established, documented laboratory recognition guidelines.\n\nb. Proposed Compliance Assessment Bulletins (CABs).\n\nc. Proposed updates to previously approved CABs, as Notices of Proposed CABs, to enable comment and input on the proposed CAB modifications.\n\nd. OIC updates to existing test documents or establishing new test documents for new types of P25 equipment.\n\ne. Best practices associated with improvement of the policies and procedures by which the P25 CAP operates.\n\nf. Existing test documents including but not limited to SDOCs and STRs posted on the dhs.gov/science-and-technology/p25-cap website.\n\ng.

It now says it has spent money to help workers improve productivity, such as the purchase and use of mobile tools and robots and allowing employees to work in satellite offices, though the company did not disclose how much these measures cost. \n \nDentsu President Toshihiro Yamamoto told reporters on Oct. 6, after the Tokyo court decision, that changing the culture of working long hours would weigh on its earnings. \"We have cut working time before achieving ideal productivity,\" he said. \n \nDentsu's revenue for the nine months rose 12% to 657 billion yen, and unconsolidated revenue fell only 2%.

This virus causes severe diarrhea, nausea, and stomach pain. \n \nAlthough often referred to as the \u201ccruise ship\u201d virus in the United States, noroviruses are an expensive and serious public health problem particularly among young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised patients. Now, in a new study published in Immunity this week, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have used a mouse model to show that, even in immunized animals, noroviruses can escape the immune system and still spread by hiding out in an extremely rare type of cell in the gut. \n \n\u201cCurrent vaccines against norovirus have been ineffective despite eliciting strong antibody responses,\u201d said senior author E. John Wherry, PhD, a professor of Microbiology and director of the Penn Institute for Immunology. \u201cUnderstanding the unique norovirus characteristic of hiding from the host immune system may explain its biology and present opportunities to improve vaccines and therapeutics.\u201d \n \nWhile most infected people clear the virus within a few days, some individuals continue to shed virus for weeks to months after. Such persistently infected people may be a source of outbreaks, but it was unclear why the immune system fails to eliminate the virus in these cases. \n \n\u201cThe cruise ship outbreaks of norovirus are high profile, but it happens everywhere \u2013 daycare centers, eldercare facilities, and more,\u201d said first author Vesselin T. Tomov, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Gastroenterology. \u201cNoroviruses can cause persistent infections, challenging the long-held view that they are transient pathogens.\u201d \n \nThe Penn investigators defined and tracked T-cell responses in mice infected with either an acute or chronic strain of mouse norovirus to gain insight into mechanisms of viral clearance and persistence. At first, they hypothesized that persistent norovirus infection caused T cells to become exhausted rendering them non-functioning, similar to other chronic viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C. To their surprise, however, T cells remained functional even after months of norovirus infection. \n \nThe team then looked at the earliest stages of response by the immune system and found two phases to that response. During the initial days after infection, T cells reacted strongly to the virus and controlled it. But, after about three days, T cells could no longer detect norovirus in 50 to 70 percent of the mice infected with the chronic strain. \n \nThe researchers faced a paradox because the T cells responding to the virus appeared \u201cignorant\u201d or \u201cunable to see\u201d the virus, yet there was continuous shedding of norovirus in mouse feces. To explain this conundrum, they next hypothesized that actively multiplying norovirus had been sequestered somewhere in the gut out of reach of T cells. \n \nTomov conducted a series of experiments to test that hypothesis. He eventually found evidence that norovirus does hide in rare gut cells that fail to communicate with T cells and alert them of the presence of the pathogen. \u201cWe found a novel escape mechanism where norovirus becomes essentially invisible to the immune system in the intestine while still producing large amounts of virus that is shed from the intestines,\u201d Tomov said. \n \nCoauthors at Washington University have found that norovirus hides in specialized, ultra-rare cells of the gut lining, on the order of only a few hundred cells out of the billions that line the mouse gut. These cells act as mega factories for norovirus production, while allowing the virus to evade the immune system. The team is now working on this aspect of norovirus infection. \n \nThese findings might help explain why norovirus vaccines being tested have shown limited effectiveness and also hint that future vaccines would need to elicit immunity that acts very robustly in the first three days after infection before the virus moves into hiding. The results also dovetail with the fact that no one has yet found an animal reservoir for the virus. \u201cThere may be some people out there who are living with the chronic strain of the virus and are persistently, yet unknowingly, shedding it,\u201d Tomov said. \n \nNext, the researchers plan to investigate how to improve protection against this virus by combining T cell and antibody approaches for vaccines. Identifying the cellular reservoir of norovirus may also enable the development of therapeutics to help prevent or purge persisting infection. In addition, testing whether similar mechanisms occur in humans is a major goal that will not only enable better vaccine development, but also help test for a potential role of norovirus as a co-factor in other intestinal diseases. \n Chinese \u00a0French \u00a0German \u00a0Italian \u00a0Japanese \u00a0Korean \u00a0Portuguese \u00a0Russian \u00a0Spanish"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [21, 12, 14, 5, 4, 6, 13, 19, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 23, 12, 13, 14, 21, 5, 4, 6], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [21, 12, 13, 14, 5, 19, 4, 23, 6], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 5, 21, 14, 4, 23, 6, 12], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [19, 15, 14, 12, 5, 23, 21, 13, 4, 6, 15], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Ten of the 35 families evicted from a building behind Home Affairs have been moved by the municipality to a deserted church.\nTwo families have built shacks inside the old church yard and others have each taken a section of the old building.\nSome have built partitions on the second floor.\nThabang Ngubane also built a shack inside the church yard.\nHe shares it with his wife, children and 88-year-old father-in-law.\nHe has no ID and has never registered for a house.\nHe moved in with his children and grandchildren.\nHe said: \"Little did l know we would soon be homeless\".\nThe office of the Gauteng Premier asked me to look into the case.", "text": "Ten of the 35 families evicted from a building behind Home Affairs in Nigel, who spent a week sleeping in the open, have been moved by the municipality to a deserted church on the R51 Springs road.

An increased amount of carbon monoxide can accumulate in the home, posing a serious threat to anyone inside. \n\nJohnson refers to carbon monoxide as the \"invisible killer\" because it is odorless, colorless and no one can tell if it has permeated the home until it's too late. \n\nAnother tip is to frequently check fire alarms and smoke detectors to be sure both are working properly. \n\nJohnson also emphasized to make sure heating sources are not easily accessible to children. \n \n\"Some people will use their oven to try and heat their home, especially if they don't have portable space heaters or their main heat system does not work efficiently,\" he said, \"but you should never use your stove or oven as a heat source.\" \n\nAdditional tips from the Nation Fire Protection Association are: \n\n\u2022 Have a qualified service professional annually inspect heating systems, especially in the months prior to temperatures dropping. \n\n\u2022 Never use a space heater or any other heating appliance with a damaged cord. \n\n\u2022 Never plug space heaters into an extension cord \n\n\u2022 Place space heaters only on level, flat services \n\n\u2022 Never leave them unattended. \n\n\u2022 Turn them off when leaving the room, home or sleeping.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [13, 21, 4, 12, 23, 6, 19, 14, 5], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [21, 19, 14, 5, 12, 23, 6, 13, 4], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 13, 21, 14, 12, 19, 5, 4], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [13, 21, 19, 6, 23, 12, 14, 4, 5], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 21, 13, 23, 6, 14, 5, 15, 19, 12, 4], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) in the US published the final ruling covering renewable fuel volume requirements for 2018.\nThe ruling increases requirements for advanced biofuels in the biomass - based diesel category.\nMany public and private fleets in California use Neste MY Renewable Diesel to meet their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.", "text": "Friday, Dec 01, 2017 \n The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the US published the final ruling covering renewable fuel volume requirements for 2018 under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program on 30 November 2017. \nNeste MY Renewable Diesel meets the requirements of an advanced biofuel in the biomass-based diesel category.

Far from it. Despite spending almost a decade interviewing the world\u2019s top investors about their strategies and mindset as a financial journalist, I struggled to even bring myself to open an ISA. I clearly remember how experts never thought the FTSE 100 would break the 7,000 mark, but I can\u2019t recall which hole in the ground my savings fell into. I even spent 18 months working in New York and wracked up hundreds of pounds in bank charges because I didn\u2019t get one of those\u2026 foreign currency card thingys.\n\nAnd if I\u2019ve been a bit, shall we say, lax, with my cash, then I imagine many others are in the same boat? After all, most of us didn\u2019t get financial education at school, and I think a lesson on pensions or how to send an invoice would have been more useful than weekly experiments in Home Economics about how much baking soda can ruin a brownie.In my defence, it\u2019s tempting to be apathetic in a world where most of the \u201cbenefits\u201d of products like pensions and ISAs benefit the truly rich. Getting on the property ladder is almost impossible \u2013 most of us need our parents to help out. The cycle of poverty is real, and money only makes more money if you have it in the first place.My third excuse is that money, for some unfathomable reason, is put in the same category as rocket science \u2013 technical, detailed, irrelevant \u2013 or it\u2019s seen as an imminent disaster, with American pundits screaming on cable news about the latest hot stock or announcement by the central bank. We put money experts on a pedestal and worship them \u2013 and that didn\u2019t turn out so well for former fund manager star Neil Woodford. But money is not an exclusive club. For example, we don\u2019t need to be up to speed on the ramifications of every by-election to take an interest in politics. We also don\u2019t need to know the direction of equity markets (they normally go up over the long term anyway) or know the interest rate of a government bond to sort out our finances. So, the million-dollar question: how can I get better with my money? One is learning, and talking to other people about their finances. Taking small steps at a time. Deciding what I really want and focusing on my goals, rather than saving for a future I don\u2019t know is going to happen. (Despite women\u2019s mags advising me to the contrary, I refuse to give up my takeaway coffee most days \u2013 I get a discount with my KeepCup.) I\u2019ve taken some simple steps over the last year instead: consolidate my pensions into one pot; invest in premium bonds; open a stocks and shares ISA; put aside 30 per cent of my income to pay tax and student loan, and cut down on what I spend i.e. subscriptions and fast fashion.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent eventsThere is a higher purpose here, I like to think. In the UK, there is a very significant gender pay gap (8.6 per cent for full-time workers), a gender pension gap (almost 40 per cent in 2017/18) and a gender investment gap, (YouGov research shows that 52 per cent of women have never put their money into an investment product, compared to 37 per cent of men). And while what we really need is to change the overarching structures that affect those gaps i.e. corporate transparency and legislation \u2013 in the meantime we can at least gain confidence in our own money matters.And we should gain confidence, because research shows that women make good, if not better, investors compared to men. Women are more risk averse, and less emotional. As someone who has interviewed the man who brought down Barings Bank in the 1990s through excessive risk taking, I believe this to be true.\n\nIn other words, I want to shake that magic money tree.

Tribe elders have collaborated with PLDT wireless unit Smart Communications and other partners to develop a mobile application that teaches basic literacy in the Matigsalug language. Smart is donating tablets to the community to enable its members to use the app. \n \nThe Matigsalug app, now available for free download on Android devices, has interactive features teaching users how to pronounce letters properly and how to write the alphabet through tracing. It also teaches word association and how to count in Matigsalug. \n \nMoreover, it lets users sing along to Matigsalug songs for children. It also features tribal dances and chants. \n \nThe project is part of Smart\u2019s efforts to digitize educational content in local languages to help enhance learning among Filipino youth. Smart has already launched literacy apps in Cebuano and Arabic, and is currently working on a similar app for Kapampangan, Waray, Chavacano, and the Blaan and Tagakaulo indigenous peoples (IP) languages. \n \n\u201cAside from studies showing that children learn better when they are taught using their mother tongue, there is also research showing that the managed use of digital learning tools and content can improve their literacy skills and heighten their interest in learning. This is why we have partnered with different local government units, local divisions of the Department of Education, schools, and developers to create literacy apps in different local languages,\u201d said Smart Public Affairs Senior Manager Stephanie Orlino. \n \nFor the Matigsalug app, Smart partnered with tribal members from Sitio Contract at the Marilog District in Davao City, as well as with the Pamulaan Center for IP Education for the provision of content. \n \nMeanwhile, ACLC College of General Santos City and Davao City and Skeptron Business Solutions helped with the animation and digitization of content.

Evidently, sexual deprivation is the largest reason that the lives of young children, boys and girls alike, are being ruined. So what's the fix? Who should we be protecting our kids from? Knowing how rapidly a disease like pedophilia is increasing in Pakistani society, and seeing how the police are least interested in these cases, who should the government appoint to control such an epidemic ? Should local authorities with power be more attentive to these cases? Should local schools be more articulate when explaining topics related to sex?

Literally, nothing.\" \n\nThe Chelsea youngster's social media post appeared to be criticising his club for not giving him more first-team opportunities.

Charly could have a good opportunity this season to play because we only have three No 10s: Hazard, Willian and Pedro. Usually two No 10s play, so this season could be good for him to show that he deserves to play.\" \n\nWith Willian struggling for form, there are Chelsea supporters who feel the youngster already deserves a first Premier League start. While there are concerns about his slender frame even at the age of 21, Musonda offered enough in 25 minutes against Crystal Palace to suggest he is a viable alternative to the out-of-sorts Brazilian. The potential is obvious. \n\nMusonda came on as a substitute for Chelsea against Crystal Palace \n\nSpeaking to Chelsea's former academy coach Adi Viveash in the summer, it was clear that he is a huge admirer of Musonda. The player was part of the team that won the FA Youth Cup and the UEFA Youth League under Viveash in 2015 with the coach recalling his \"individual brilliance\" and a group of players who \"had everything\". Even so, the wait goes on. \n\n\"Everyone can be critical and have their own opinion about players getting through to the first team at Chelsea,\" said Viveash. \"It has been discussed so many times. But there is only one man who picks the Chelsea first team and that's the manager. That is it. \n\n\"It does not mean players are not ready because I am 100 per cent convinced that over the past five years there have been players who were ready to play in Chelsea's first team. That is a discussion for someone else. If they cannot play there and they are good enough then they have to go and play somewhere else.\" \n\nRay Wilkins believes Chelsea's squad is weaker than when they won the title \n\nRay Wilkins believes Chelsea's squad is weaker than when they won the title \n\nThat is the conclusion that Musonda's long-time team-mate Dominic Solanke made in the summer. Nathaniel Chalobah did the same. The latter will miss out on a return to Stamford Bridge with Watford on Saturday due to injury but he can feel vindicated nevertheless having already made five times as many starts for the Hornets as he made for Chelsea. \n\nCoincidentally, Chalobah, like Solanke, could well have featured more regularly had he stayed given Chelsea's recent injury crisis. N'Golo Kante and Danny Drinkwater are missing in midfield, while first-choice striker Alvaro Morata has only just returned following a hamstring problem. Conte has been open about his frustrations. \n\nChelsea vs Watford \n\nOctober 21, 2017, 11:30am \n\nLive on \n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \n\n\"The situation is difficult,\" he said in midweek. \"We have to play every three days and it is not simple. Also because, in this moment, we are thin we have to play always the same players.\" Summer target Radja Nainggolan lined up for opponents Roma on Wednesday and the Chelsea boss clearly wishes the club had added more depth to the squad in the summer. \n\nAnd yet, there remains an alternative. The option is there to trust in the talents of the country's most successful academy of the past decade. To give the gifted young players at Stamford Bridge the chance to play some Premier League football. Musonda will be waiting to see that team sheet against Watford.

Joe Biden is no stranger to high-profile Hollywood outings. In fact, the former vice president has visited Los Angeles many times and even took the stage at the 2016 Oscars to introduce Lady Gaga's performance of \"Til it Happens to You.\" His appearance Wednesday night at a Beverly Hills fundraiser \u2014 organized by Gonring, Spahn and Associates along with Jeffrey Katzenberg and held at the offices of WndrCo \u2014 may not have answered the burning question of whether he will run for president in 2020, but still proved to be engaging, sources say.\n\nApproximately 25 people attended the $5,000-per-plate fundraiser, which raised a little more than $100,000, funds that will be funneled toward Biden\u2019s PAC American Possibilities, which supports Democratic candidates and causes. Notable names in attendance were Paramount\u2019s Jim Gianopulos, Sony Pictures\u2019 Tom Rothman, producer Byron Allen, ICM Partners' Chris Silberman, Gonring Spahn\u2019s Andy Spahn, Katzenberg, venture capitalist Chris Sacca, entrepreneur Jon Vein and Meg Whitman. \n\nAccording to one attendee, Biden was in the building for 90 minutes and was introduced by Katzenberg. The former vice president then gave a short address where he touched on the politics of the day, but avoided the question of whether he plans to run for president in two years. Biden then participated in a Q&A session that lasted for about 45 minutes.\n\nA source said the event felt more like an intimate gathering rather than a glitzy fundraiser, adding that it felt like \u201cheartfelt\u201d conversation among old friends. \u201cJoe was super engaging. He was strong and thoughtful. It was a dynamic conversation.\u201d \n\nAn event of this stature signals to observers that Biden is taking a possible 2020 presidential candidacy very seriously, though he didn't say much on the subject. The 75-year-old, who served under President Barack Obama, could enter the presidential race as one of the frontrunners, though he has maintained that any decision about whether he would seek a third presidential bid would come only after the upcoming November midterm elections, now just weeks away.\n\nBiden isn\u2019t the only notable Democratic candidate on the shortlist for 2020 who is testing waters among the Hollywood donor class.

This would also mean we would need to charge a lot more for entrance fees to the centre, which may mean that some residents may not be able to afford regular use of the facility, which really makes the entire project pointless, as this is here for all the community, not just the few.\u201d \n \nAs such, Hamilton has now decided to launch the centre as a not-for-profit community business which will be owned, operated and run by the community, for the community. \n \n\u201cBy launching the place as a not-for-profit, this means we will have access to a large range of funding and grants, we will not need to take out extensive loans, all income will be reinvested into the business, we will be able to charge much less for entry fees and the business will be managed by a board, for the benefit of the community, not for the benefit of one person\u2019s profits.\u201d \n \nFeasibility studies, market research, consultations, property and land surveys, as well as meetings with designers and tours of similar projects have already taken place.

Consent can be given, even with reluctance.

He says she willingly performed oral sex on him.

The woman alleges he entered the room naked, thrust his penis at her and said: \u201cYou f**ked those guys. Why not me?\u201d Mr McIlroy says he entered the room fully clothed and the woman performed consensual oral sex on him. \n \nUnlike the first three charges, the woman\u2019s consent is not relevant to this accusation.

He is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police or omitting relevant facts which could have helped the investigation. Mr Harrison is accused of not disclosing relevant facts to officers when they took a witness statement from him on June 30th, 2016, two days after the alleged rape. These facts include: \n A text he received from the complainant in the hours after the alleged rape stating \u201cwhat happened was not consensual\u201d,  That he allegedly saw nudity on the night in question as demonstrated by a text he sent stating \u201cwent upstairs and there were more flutes than the Twelfth of July\u201d,  That he believed \u201cthings weren\u2019t going to end well\u201d after the alleged rape as demonstrated by a text he sent Mr McIlroy to that effect,  And that the complainant was significantly more distressed when he dropped her home in a taxi than he let on to police.  \nThe defence say he provided a truthful account and answered all questions put to him to the best of his ability. They deny he engaged in a cover-up to protect his friends. \n \nTo convict on this count the jury must be sure: \n Between June 27th and July 1st, 2016 Mr Harrison made a witness statement to police lying about his dealings with the woman or deliberating omitting relevant information,  It was possible that lie or omission could have perverted the course of justice  And that Mr Harrison intended to pervert the course of justice.  \nCount 6 \n \nMr Harrison is also accused of withholding information from police. Although it sounds similar to count 5, it is quite different and involves separate elements which must be proved by the prosecution before jurors can convict. Jurors must be sure: \n A rape offence was committed between June 27th, 2016 and October 5th, 2016,  Mr Harrison knew or believed a rape offence had been committed  And he knew or believed he had information which was likely to help with the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of the guilty party.  \nUnlike the other allegations which all stand alone, for the jury to convict on this count it must be sure a rape occured. If it acquits Jackson and Olding of rape it must return a not guilty verdict on this count too."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [6, 4, 23, 19, 13, 12, 14, 21, 5], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [6, 12, 19, 5, 13, 21, 14, 23, 4], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 5, 13, 4, 12, 19, 23, 21, 14], "scores": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [21, 6, 4, 19, 14, 5, 23, 13, 12], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [12, 15, 19, 23, 14, 4, 15, 13, 5, 21, 6], "scores": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]}}, "summary": "The two teams are separated by just fourpoints, but Jamshedpur have played a game less.\n\"I hope (that we can score goals).\nI am exactly like every supporterwho comes to games and am desperate to see the team score goals.", "text": "The battle of tactical supremacy is on thecards when two of stingiest defences of Hero Indian Super League'ssides Jamshedpur FC and Mumbai City FC will clash at the JRD TataSports Complex here tomorrow.Home side Jamshedpur FC have let in just two goals in sevenencounters, with Subrata Pal keeping five clean sheets in the process.As for Mumbai City, they have conceded seven goals - five of thesehave been away from home.

With USD 142 billion net worth, Bezos tops the ranking of richest persons, according to\u00a0 Bloomberg Billionaires Index .\u00a0 \n \nAccording to a CNBC report , Amazon\u2019s customer base has remained loyal through the latest Prime price hike in exchange for a slew of services and perks, and the company\u2019s stock has continued to increase in value. Since June 1, the tech titan\u2019s net worth has grown over $5 billion and now totals $141.9 billion, according to the Forbes World\u2019s Billionaires list. That makes Bezos worth roughly $49 billion more than Bill Gates and about $60 billion more than Warren Buffett. \n \nEarlier this year, Bezos officially became the richest person in the world and also helped make Amazon the second most valuable company in the world, behind Apple. His success can arguably be traced back to a risk he took when he was 30 years old, when Bezos was a high school student and the class valedictorian, and he got accepted via early admission to Princeton, according to Brad Stone\u2019s biography \u201cThe Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.\u201d He majored in computer science and electrical engineering, and then went on to work various finance and tech jobs after college. \n \nIt was while serving as a vice president at the hedge fund D. E. Shaw in the 1990s that Bezos came up with the idea to sell books over the Internet. Doing so, though, would mean taking a significant risk and perhaps sacrificing his stable job. Experts believe the\u00a0Amazon CEO is here to play to long game, and it is here for everyone to see as Bezos is remaking the world with its business acumen and operational prowess. \n \nThere are a number of things Amazon has taken in its strides, where his rivals falter.\u00a0The\u00a0 2017 Walker Sands Future of Retail \u00a0study found 84% of US consumers have made a purchase on Amazon in the past year, and 55% are Prime subscribers. Consumers are increasingly using other Amazon offerings too, like voice devices (16%), grocery (14% - Pantry, 10% - Fresh) and Dash buttons (5%). \n \nAlso Millennials love Amazon.\u00a0According to Yes Lifecycle Marketing\u2019s report \u201c A Marketer\u2019s Guide to Reaching Each Consumer Generation ,\u201d nearly four in five (79%) millennials have purchased from Amazon in the past month, and 55% shop at Amazon for the Prime benefits \u2014 more than any other generation. \n \nThe next in line is Bill Gates with USD 94.2 billion. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, the world\u2019s biggest software maker, owns about 1 per cent of the Redmond, Washington-based company.\u00a0Gates, the man who made Microsoft is more of an executor than a visionary. Rather than merely innovating or dreaming, Gates took a disciplined approach toward software as a potential source of business opportunities. \n \n\u201cAs we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others, said Gates. \n \nAs a leader his leadership style has a mixture of autocratic, visionary and participative approaches. He is actively involved in technology development for new products and in making various strategic decisions. He spends most of his time for staying touch with customers and employees around the world. He expects his managers to have their own personal influence and to take decisions assuming they are the CEO of the organization which showed the participative leadership style. \u00a0 \n \nBill Gates sees and thinks differently than most people do.\u00a0 David Aston, who worked with Gates mentions in his blog that gates has an amazing ability to find the flaws, or see opportunities, or connect the dots.\u00a0 He can zoom in to details with precision or zoom out to the big picture.\u00a0 He can flip back in time or fast forward to the future.\u00a0 He also has the ability to focus on the merits of the idea or innovation before worrying about the business case.\u00a0 Chances are, you could benefit from Bill\u2019s thinking skills, even if it simply means getting a new perspective on your problems.\u00a0 \n \nLike a true entrepreneur, Gates saw the \u201cstructural holes\u201d in the personal computing marketplace and moved in to occupy them, always in a subordinate spot to the big players. His method was: \u2018Act strategically, partner powerfully\u2019, which made him different from most others. \n \nFacebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg with USD 81.6 billion net worth has become the third richest person on the globe. He has overtaken Warren Buffett to sit at the third position in the global ranking of richest persons. Buffett is the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway. He has given away massive wealth to charity. Once the wealthiest person, Buffett is sliding in rank thanks to his charity work. Since 2006, Buffett has donated 290 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to charity, most of them to Gates\u2019 foundation. Those shares are worth more than $50bn now. \n \nAs per Bloomberg estimates, Zuckerberg now trail only Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates. According to a Fortune report, investors love Facebook more than ever. Investors are also happy at the news that Facebook has grabbed its biggest sports streaming deal yet with the Premier League. \n \nThe Times reported that Facebook has won exclusive rights to show all 380 live matches in parts of S.E Asia from 2019 until 2022, in a deal worth about $264 million. Since going public in 2012, Facebook has seen its stock rise more than 400 per cent. Nonetheless, Facebook has already been grappling with privacy issues like the Cambridge Analytica data scandal involving 87 million users and another bug that changed 14 million users\u2019 privacy setting defaults to public. In the latest privacy controversy, Facebook admitted that over 800,000 users were affected by a bug on its platform and Messenger that unblocked some people the users had blocked. \n \nMeanwhile, Mukesh Ambani, Managing Director of Reliance Industries is at the 18th spot with a net worth of USD 39.6 billion.\u00a0When we talk about telecom sector, we definitely think of Reliance Jio who has changed the phase of this industry. With its unlimited data, calls, cashback offers, heavy SMS services and many other freebies, RJio continued to be on the nerves of rivals like Airtel, Idea and Vodafone who have no other option but to also follow the game to survive, either by offering cheapest services or by entering into consolidation in just one year.\u00a0 \n \nMukesh Ambani owns the world\u2019s largest oil refining complex as well as a 27-story mansion that\u2019s been called the world\u2019s most expensive private residence, according to the Bloomberg. \n \nOf course, tech CEOs have always been dominating other global indexes - being the thought leaders in the digital era.\u00a0As Gartner projects the worldwide IT spending to total $3.7 trillion in 2018, an increase of 6.2 percent from 2017s and will continue capitalizing on the evolution of\u00a0 digital business , it is small wonder that more and more tech leaders will get wealthier and rise to prominence.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [21, 14, 12, 5, 13, 19, 23, 6, 4], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [12, 21, 19, 14, 5, 4, 13, 6, 23], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [12, 5, 14, 21, 4, 19, 13, 23, 6], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [12, 13, 21, 5, 14, 23, 6, 19, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 13, 21, 12, 19, 4, 23, 6, 15], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Simon Fitzmaurice has become a sort of legend in Irish cultural circles.\nAfter contracting motor neurone disease , the mule refused to sit back from his ambitions as a film - maker.\nHe has completed a memoir of his illness titled It ' s Not Yet Dark.\nDirector Frankie Fenton has brought visual variety to his largely chronological retelling of an often - appalling story.\nColin Farrell speaks the words with a mellifluousness that never dips into the melodramatic.\nStephen Rennicks delivers an effective , unobtrusive score for film.", "text": "Over the last few years, Simon Fitzmaurice has become a sort of legend in Irish cultural circles. He is the stubborn mule who, after contracting motor neurone disease, refused to sit back from his ambitions as a film-maker and, assisted by friends and technology, directed the accomplished feature My Name is Emily . Clearly a man with a restless brain, Fitzmaurice \u2013 relying on an eye-gaze computer \u2013 also completed a memoir of his illness titled It\u2019s Not Yet Dark . Now it has become a moving, lively documentary. He\u2019s an example to us all. \n\nWithout imposing any gimmicks, director Frankie Fenton , an experienced television professional, has brought visual variety to his largely chronological retelling of an often-appalling story. He incorporates gorgeous mobile shots of the Irish countryside. A visit to Australia following diagnosis allows sunlight into a story that is already starting to close in upon the viewer. For a picture that has much to do with depletion, It\u2019s Not Yet Dark buzzes with all the right sorts of energy. \n \nTop talent fleshes out the credits and adds class to the package. Colin Farrell speaks Fitzmaurice\u2019s words with a mellifluousness that never dips into the melodramatic. Stephen Rennicks , frequent collaborator with Lenny Abrahamson, delivers an effective, unobtrusive score. \n  \n[embedded content] \n  An ordinary upbringing  \nAfter an introduction that lays out the complications of Fitzmaurice\u2019s condition \u2013 paralysed from the neck down, he breathes via respirator and communicates with a voice simulator \u2013 we drift back to hear about an ordinary middle-class upbringing. He was smart but he didn\u2019t try very hard at school. He and his dad loved watching classic cinema together. The most important voice, aside from that of the narrator, belongs to Ruth Fitzmaurice , Simon\u2019s wife (now an acclaimed author of a revelatory memoir). Early on she reveals that, in their first meetings, Simon came across as an arrogant jerk. She soon softened to him, but that initial impression hints at a strength of personality that will serve him well when the illness strikes. \n \nRuth relates the many hardships they were to face, but she is not allowed (or does not allow herself) to wallow in any sort of self-pity. The sense throughout is of a relentless drive forward. Halt and the earth might swallow them up. \n \nFollowing college and film school, Fitzmaurice directed a fine short that took him to the Sundance Film Festival. While walking the streets of Park City, Utah, a stubborn pain in his foot continued to nag. Nobody thought anything much of it. But a doctor eventually diagnosed the same disease that has clawed away at Stephen Hawking. \n Arctic explorer\u2019s beard  \nArchive footage leads towards a destination with which we are already familiar. Now wrapped in a sturdy, Arctic explorer\u2019s beard, Simon relies upon dedicated staff to keep him aloft. The film is good on the logistical and aesthetic details of that care. Ruth and Simon considered changing the American-tinged vowels of his voice simulator, but, by that stage, they reckoned it had become an immovable part of his personality. A visiting boffin explains how the technology functions. Later still, we get fascinating insights into how \u2013 making much use of storyboards and the admirable Liz Gill as support director \u2013 he managed to stay in control of My Name is Emily on set. \n \nThere is much wisdom in Fitzmaurice\u2019s text. (\u201cThe best part of living with MND is living,\u201d he wryly notes). As was the case with My Name is Emily , there are also, for this critic\u2019s taste, a few too many outbreaks of borderline-New Age inspirational sloganeering. Mind you, if any person should be indulged in that regard it is Simon Fitzmaurice.

A TEA is defined as a rural area or an area where the unemployment rate is at least 150% of the national average. The EB-5 program has delegated to states the authority to designate various TEAs on a project-specific basis. By locating a commercial enterprise in a state-designated TEA, foreign investors sharply reduce the size of investment that is needed to qualify for a green card. \n\nThe EB-5 regulations, which were written in 1990, take a geocentric approach to defining TEAs by assuming that an enterprise's employees live near its principle place of business. In 1990, this was not an unreasonable assumption. It is today. It is now common for American workers to physically commute to jobs that are located in different metropolitan areas and to cyber-commute to jobs anywhere in the country. Internet-based employment is an efficient means of providing economic opportunities to workers who live in rural America and areas of high unemployment. \n\nThe current TEA designation process has been the subject of criticism over concerns that the EB-5 investments are not helping the program's intended beneficiaries. In response to criticism and the passage of time, DHS is updating its EB-5 regulations. DHS's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking explains that the program's reliance \"on states' TEA designations has resulted in the application of inconsistent rules by different states. ... the deference to state determinations provided by current regulations has resulted in the acceptance of some TEAs that consist of areas of relative economic prosperity linked to areas with lower employment, and some TEAs that have been criticized as 'gerrymandered.'\" \n\nDHS's response to this concern is a proposal to (1) centralize TEA decisions in Washington and (2) create an even more georestrictive requirement for TEAs. The proposed rule does not consider Americans who could \"commute\" to work via the internet. In short, the proposed regulation doubles-down on the 1990 mindset that workers live near their place of employment, a faulty assumption that has helped fuel the \"gerrymandering\" issue. \n\nThere is no statutory requirement that new commercial enterprises be physically located in TEAs in order for investors to qualify for the TEA provisions of the EB-5 program. To the contrary, the statute states that investor visas \"shall be reserved for qualified immigrants who invest in a new commercial enterprise ... which will create employment in a targeted employment area.\" \n\nOne option for the EB-5 program would be to allow a new commercial enterprise to qualify for TEA EB-5 investment, irrespective of the business's location, by committing to hire workers who live in a designated TEA. By leveraging the internet, the EB-5 program could provide technology jobs to Americans who live in rural and high unemployment areas. \n\nBy Bruce Levinson, SVP, Regulatory Intervention - Center for Regulatory Effectiveness \n\nRelated topics: Law, Policy & Regulation\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [6, 19, 21, 23, 5, 14, 4, 12, 13], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 4, 23, 6, 14, 21, 5, 12], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [12, 21, 14, 5, 19, 6, 23, 4, 13], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [13, 4, 21, 14, 5, 12, 19, 6, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [4, 19, 6, 12, 21, 23, 5, 14, 13, 15], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "L'Or\u00e9al will present its latest beauty tech innovations at Viva Technology Paris.\nFor the first time worldwide, The company has acquired The technology from ModiFace.\nSkinCeuticals will present Custom D.O.S.E For the first time in Europe.\nL'Or\u00e9al luxury professional hair care brand will present a personal diagnostic for scalp and hair fiber quality.\nTo showcase how new technologies help enhance agility and efficiency.", "text": "For the 3rd edition of Viva Technology Paris, L\u2019Or\u00e9al will present its latest beauty tech innovations at Viva Technology Paris, displaying how digital technologies enhance the future of beauty providing an \u201caugmented\u201d consumer experience. \n \n\u201cThe New Beauty Experience\u201d: Personalized digital products and services \nVisitors will be able to immerse themselves into new digital beauty experiences on a journey across three areas of daily life \u2013 a bathroom, a hair salon and a boutique.

It was pointed out that with a dismally narrow tax base of Sales Tax registered persons comprising hardly 35000 in number, it is virtually impossible for the importers, manufacturers and suppliers of goods to find registered buyers or those willing to provide their CNIC details. Consequently the inventories of unsold goods with traders, stockists, importers and manufacturers are piling up, blocking their entire working capital as well as the funds borrowed from banks. The overnight change has put entire trade and industry in a quandary as to whether or not to continue in business because it is simply not possible to find registered buyers or those willing to provide their CNIC. \n\nKCCI and other trade bodies are overwhelmed with complaints from traders, importers, manufacturers and dealers to take up this serious issue with Finance Ministry and FBR to find a workable solution immediately to pre-empt a crisis within the trade and industry, he added.

He further urged the authorities to defer the proposed measure for at least one year so as to facilitate a gradual transition from current procedure and to help release the working capital of entire supply chain which is currently blocked.

However, they conduct their businesses globally and therefore earn significant revenue from markets abroad. \n \nUS Tech companies prefer keeping their foreign revenue in offshore tax havens for obvious reasons. America is known for its high tax rates. \n \nTech companies have to distribute dividends. Some of those companies roll out \u201cshare buyback\u201d schemes. Others have different types of financial commitments to meet. Executing these activities requires Billions of US Dollars. From an investors\u2019 point of view, a question that arises is how exactly these companies meet their financial obligations in the US while their funds are parked outside of the US. \n \nThe financial industry facilitates these tech companies to meet their financial obligations. The common man is however not aware of the financial wizardry involved. \n \nTech companies over the years issued corporate bonds in the American debt market to meet their financing needs. The interest amount paid/to be paid on account of sales of these bonds was less as compared to tax liability on funds parked abroad, if they ever were repatriated. Over the period of time, these tech companies became \u201clarge corporate bond sellers\u201d. Bloomberg named them \u201cnon-financial borrowers\u201d. \n \nBusiness Insider (UK) reported in April 2018 that \u201cApple has the largest cash pile ($261 billion) amongst US companies\u201d. It further said that \u201ca large chunk of that cash pile is stashed overseas (out of the USA)\u201d. As per Bloomberg (31 August, 2018), Apple has accumulated corporate debt of more than $150 billion. \n \nRather than focusing on any specific company, let\u2019s study the overall impact of these tech companies on the US economy. \n \nBefore Trump administration, tech companies were continuing with their strategy of corporate bond sales and were piling up US debt market to meet their cash flow requirements (e.g. acquisitions, share buybacks, shareholder payouts etc.). The recent tax overhaul, made by Trump administration incentivised these Tech companies to repatriate their funds to USA. \n \nBloomberg reports (on 31 August, 2018) that after the revision of tax regulations, tech companies have repatriated $306 billion from abroad. \u201cStrategas Securities\u201d, a US based brokerage and advisory firm estimates that the total amount could reach\u00a0 $700 billion by end of the year (2018). \n \nImpact of Repatriation \n \nWith funds in hand, most of the tech giants intend to \u201cbuyback\u201d their shares. For an existing shareholder, the share buyback is like a dividend payout, albeit more attractive. The companies benefit from it because decreased supply of its shares in the equity market raises its share price, a simple application of demand and supply theory. \n \nThe following example makes it simple to understand the financial benefit of \u201cshare buyback\u201d. (Please note that rates and amounts given are for example purposes). \n \nFunds repatriated from abroad, if invested in Treasury bills \u2013\u00a0 $100 @ 2% equals to $2. \n \nPayout to shareholders who hold shares worth the $100 @ 10% equals to $10 \n \nThe resulting economic value is \u201cnegative\u201d ($8). \n \nTherefore, if $100 worth of shares are \u201cbought back\u201d from shareholders, it will result in significant savings. \n \nIt is very easy to comprehend that repatriated excess funds, if utilised for \u201cshare buyback\u201d, will save money for these tech giants long term. Hoarding cash now is not wise. In fact, the savings can be utilised to pay corporate debt liabilities as and when they become due. \n \nUS corporate debt market was significantly influenced by these \u201cnon-financial borrowers\u201d. In coming years it will see a significant decline in sales of corporate bonds. The economic pundits are working on different probable outcomes that might result due to sudden cash influx caused by tech giants. By end of this year, actual position will surface out and future direction of the US corporate debt market will be set."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 5, 12, 19, 13, 21, 14, 4], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [6, 21, 14, 23, 12, 5, 4, 13, 19], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [12, 23, 6, 21, 13, 19, 5, 14, 4], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [13, 19, 12, 21, 4, 5, 14, 23, 6], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 15, 12, 4, 21, 15, 14, 5, 23, 6], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Patsy Ferran could probably stand on stage and read bad undergraduate essay on Tennessee Williams.\nAlma is a young southern woman, a dutiful minister's daughter.\nShe's in love her with her neighbour John, a trainee doctor.\nJohn is marvellously played by Matthew Needham.\nWilliams ' play beautifully pushes this idea to its extremes.\nExcavating two personalities.\nFrecknall has a ballsy confidence in Ferran's non-naturalistic approach.\nUntil 7 April #arts#theatre#dance... almeida.co.uk.", "text": "Patsy Ferran could probably stand on stage and read a bad undergraduate essay on Tennessee Williams and it\u2019d sound like the most poignant thing you\u2019ve ever heard. This young actor is a genuine marvel, as hilarious as she is heart-breaking. And as Alma in Williams\u2019 rarely-performed 1948 play, she\u2019s hit a real high note.\n\nIn fact, Rebecca Frecknall\u2019s whole production seems to tremble like a sustained, held high note: fragile, uncertain, almost unbearably tense.\n\nMusic is key in her pleasingly abstract revival: nine pianos make a semi-circle, fronts off so you can see their anatomy (something that'll become thematically important). The cast play Angus MacRae\u2019s score like a subtext, amplifying unspoken desires and fears.\n\nAlma is a young southern woman, a dutiful minister\u2019s daughter who\u2019s so nervous she\u2019s prone to panic attacks. She\u2019s in love her with her neighbour, John, a trainee doctor. He mocks her affected, convoluted speech \u2013 which Ferran mines brilliantly for laughs, while making clear it\u2019s a protective suit for a sensitive soul.\n\nHe obviously sees something in her too, but is busy going concertedly off the rails: drinking every night at the casino, scandalously fooling around with its owner\u2019s beautiful daughter (an appropriately luscious Anjana Vasan, who at one point gives a smoking-hot, soulful rendition of Portishead\u2019s \"Glory Box\").\n\nJohn is marvellously played by Matthew Needham, amused deadpan mocks giving way to a stare so intense you worry it might set Ferran\u2019s hair on fire. John is a dick, frankly, in the way he treats women. But god, you never doubt these two are meant for each other, that they have a unique ability to kindle a fire in each other.\n\nThe moment when he unbuttons her blouse \u2013 yes, yes, she is literally buttoned up, Williams ain\u2019t always subtle \u2013 to put a stethoscope to her chest carries an insane erotic charge. Her heart\u2019s not the only one racing.\n\nOpposite attract, right? Williams\u2019 play beautifully pushes this idea to its extremes, excavating two personalities and questioning societal assumptions about what men and women really want.\n\nWe start with a dichotomy: Alma is the soul, John the body. She is order, he anarchy. He forces her to look at an anatomy chart; she knows it\u2019s missing something. Why shouldn\u2019t he just give himself up to physical pleasures, he growls? Because they could connect on a much more profound level, she insists.\n\nThey both feel it in both body and soul, really. But it\u2019s about what makes you vulnerable: he can\u2019t bear to crack open his heart, she\u2019s too scared to lift the lid on her physical desire. One of the joys of Ferran\u2019s performance is the way her incredibly exact gestures of anxiety \u2013 her hand fluttering to her neck, the mystery of what do with one\u2019s elbows \u2013 also so perfectly reveal vast stores of repressed bodily longing. She\u2019s like a glass, brimming with water; you hold your breath for the moment it\u2019ll spill. The moment, of course, comes too late.\n\nSimply staged, with only a few chairs, and gorgeously lit by Lee Curran (I loved how fireworks flashed in the bellies of the pianos), there is barely a bum note here. Frecknall\u2019s production has a ballsy confidence in its non-naturalistic approach, rescuing Williams\u2019 play from polite fussiness, but there\u2019s also delicacy and precision. An evening that makes a case for this play, announces Frecknall as a director of real vision, and confirms Ferran as one of our finest actresses.

But Jennings, who actually shared the quote above in a recent interview with Ars, is smart enough to recognize that most people don't find the same joy in \"pure\" trivia tests that he does. \nARS TECHNICA \nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica , a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast. \n\n\"If trivia is just knowledge retrieval, it's only fun if you get it right,\" Jennings told Ars. \"It shouldn't just be middle-aged dads trading baseball statistics ... It can involve deduction and lateral thinking, different kinds of cognition other than, 'Do I remember this thing my 9th grade teacher taught me.' One is fun, the other is fun only to a very, very small group of people.\" \n\nRichard Garfield, the storied creator of Magic: The Gathering (and, more recently, Valve's Artifact ), came to a similar conclusion after reading Jennings' book, Brainiac . \"I was really taken by his love of trivia,\" Garfield said. \"I learned to see trivia as being more than just a black-or-white test of whether you know it or not. Good trivia questions have an art to them, and have many more dimensions.\" \n\nAnd so, a bit more than five years ago, Garfield reached out to Jennings to \"make a trivia game that really brought those elements out.\" Today, on Kickstarter , they're finally ready to unveil Half-Truth , their attempt to turn the world of trivia games on its ear. \n\nAs a game designer, Garfield's first task in making his own trivia game was to focus on the pain points that make standard trivia quizzes so unsatisfying for many.\n\"I thought back to my evenings playing trivia games, and I saw that one of the frustrating things was when I hit a long period of time where I knew nothing, or nothing that wasn't known by almost everyone there,\" Garfield said. \"Then the one question where I was a master at the subject, where I was the only person who knew, that question got asked to someone else. So right off the bat, I resolved that everybody should be answering every question.\" \n\nGarfield also decided to stick with multiple choice questions, so players would always have a potential \"hook\" that could provide some insight into the answer. After testing cards with one right answer out of six choices, though, Garfield says he \"moved to the much more interesting place\" where three out of the six options were correct (or \"half\" true). \n\nThat means, at worst, players have a 50 percent chance of stumbling on a right answer every time. And even if they don't know the answer, players can improve those chances by eliminating answers they know are wrong or looking for patterns and groupings in the options. \n\nGarfield gave an example from testing where a card asked players to identify which of the six options were types of mushrooms. The three wrong answers\u2014Destroying Angel, Blinding Angel, and Thallid\u2014were drawn from Magic: The Gathering cards (perhaps not surprisingly, as the question was written by Garfield's wife). \"This was sort of eye-opening for me; that was a clever way to make it so there were more angles into this card. If you know Magic cards real well, you don't need to know mushrooms at all.\" \n\nFor the \"trivia jocks\" who might play the game, there's also the option to push your luck and identify two or three answers. This gives you a slight bonus if you're correct but eliminates all of that turn's progress if you get even one choice wrong, introducing some basic risk-versus-reward strategy to the design. \n\nTrivia games are usually lopsided based on who just happens to know (and can retrieve) more trivial information from their brains. But Garfield says Half-Truth 's design \"gives you this start down an egalitarian path where everybody's got a chance,\" but without making the playing field completely flat. \n\n\"The people who aren't as trivia savvy will feel like they've got more of a chance,\" Garfield said. \"Maybe they won't win, but they'll have their victories. I often try to create my games so that skillful play is an advantage, but it doesn't mean you win every single time.\" \n\nThe hope is to make each question in Half-Truth a bit of a logic puzzle that can be solved, rather than a pure test of recall. \"Right in front of you [on each card] there are three right answers,\" Jennings pointed out. \"They are right there ... you're trying to solve the riddle, figure out which is which.\" \n\nJennings recalled winning the first Half-Truth test game he played with Garfield, after a year of development, and thinking, \"Yes, exactly, this is how the universe should work. I should win trivia games.\" When they played again, though, Jennings lost, \"and I thought, this is a very smart game, because sometimes the trivia expert has a small edge, but that's not always enough ... The result is it's the rare trivia game where you remember feeling smart when you play. \n\n\"People don't feel well-informed,\" Jennings added by way of explaining the paralysis many people feel around trivia games. \"We're a very information dense society today. And people feel like they don't know enough stuff. We're constantly feeling bad about the stuff that we know. \n\n\"The beauty of trivia is that opposite feeling, when something inside your head actually pays off,\" he continued. \"That's such an amazing epiphany because it happens so rarely. We spend all this effort stuffing facts into out head, then occasionally, at a trivia board, something turns into real life points and it's delightful. Half-Truth is structured to give more people that experience.\" \n\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica ."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [14, 19, 12, 23, 6, 21, 4, 5, 15, 13], "scores": [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [21, 4, 5, 13, 12, 6, 23, 14, 19], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [23, 6, 21, 12, 19, 13, 14, 4, 5], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 4, 13, 19, 5, 14, 21, 12, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [4, 21, 14, 5, 19, 12, 13, 15, 15, 23, 6], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Unlike Jeannette Wall's \"The Glass Castle\" or Tara Westover's \"Educated,\" riveting accounts of tormented childhoods, and unlike Helen Macdonald's mysterious \"H Is for Hawk,\" which has a chronology, more or less, Dayan's book doesn't read like a conventional narrative.\nIt's about a woman who tries to exorcise the ghost of her deceased mother through writing.\nOr maybe it's the other way around.", "text": "In the Belly of Her Ghost\n\nColin Dayan\n\nLARB Books, 180 pp., $15\n\n--\n\nColin Dayan's brief but explosive memoir of her relationship to her mother should find a place among the more indelible life histories of the last several years.\n\nUnlike Jeannette Wall's \"The Glass Castle\" or Tara Westover's \"Educated,\" riveting accounts of tormented childhoods, and unlike Helen Macdonald's mysterious \"H Is for Hawk,\" which has a chronology, more or less, Dayan's book doesn't read like a conventional narrative. It's about a woman who tries to exorcise the ghost of her deceased mother through writing. As memories of her mother, a biracial woman from Haiti who passed for white in the largely Jim Crow South, force themselves into the daughter's mind, she chronicles, fearlessly, the pain and confusion that both of them suffered as they tried to find their way in a segregated, class-bound world.\n\nEach section concentrates on an aspect of the author's experience, but none tells a straight story. Photographs, snippets of songs, moments of longing and regret, scenes of confusion, loss and horror become part of a mesmeric whole. The narrative starts and stops, doesn't play by the usual temporal rules. Dayan's story refuses to obey the logic of linear time, questions the finality of death, upends rationalist notions of cause and effect, and reproduces over and over the chaotic, un-rule-governed quality of actual human experience.\n\n\"In the Belly of Her Ghost\" does not make unsettling assertions about the nature of reality in an explicit way; they are not the point of the story but its unavoidable substance. When your mother dies and comes back as a spider and makes droplets of blood appear on the walls, when her spidery presence is stamped on the veins of your own eye -- anything to get attention -- the supernatural is not a matter of belief but of life as you lived it.\n\nWe sense the author reasoning to herself: Maybe if she can call her mother up on the page, dress her in ball gowns and jewels, capture the stunning beauty of her face and form, call her to account for her life of pretense -- pretending to be white, to be upper middle class, to belong at the country club -- but also sympathize with her for the agony this caused her, maybe if we can be made to see how unhappy she was with the husband who commanded this performance, and see how unable to support and care for her child she was since she herself hardly existed, maybe then, the author hopes, the mother will finally be able to let go.\n\nOr maybe it's the other way around.\n\nIn her repeated visits to Haiti, where her mother was born, in carrying her mother's paintings, silver, china, crystal with her when she moves to take a prestigious job, in poring over the photographs of her mother that her father took compulsively, in remembering the lust in her mother's voice on the phone with a lover, her absence at school functions, perhaps Dayan is trying to possess the mother she never really had.\n\nShe had a real mother, though, just not the one who bore her. Lucille, the African American maid who cared for Colin, was everything her mother was not: racially unambiguous, real and there. If Dayan's mother haunts the book -- destructive, passionate and despairing -- Lucille cuts through the posturing with reminders of mortality. Lucille, writes Dayan, \"gave me the chance not to live a lie.\" Lucille patched her clothes, sang to her, approved of the world of snakes, frogs and spiders that Colin loved. Lucille understood things that were alive, things that could kill, things that died. \"Bugs and dirt\" is what it all comes down to in the end, said Lucille, \"bugs and dirt.\"\n\nThe memoir insists on the uncanny power of physical objects, makes them come alive. The crazed quality of her mother's things constantly erupts into the narrative: \"diamonds stashed deep into a jar of cold cream ... wicker baskets, with mangoes rotting, crosses hidden in jiffy bags, lizards bleeding in the dirt, and the heads of cocks wrapped in mosquito netting.\" The combination of ornament, violence and rot spills over into Colin's own possessions: her mutilated dolls still lie in the basement, their \"lace dresses ... intact, their hair ... cut or shaved off; and their eyes, which I had not hurt ... rotted, as if they had been eaten away by acid.\" \"Things, like ghosts,\" says Dayan, \"know what they want.\" They keep coming back in her mind, all jumbled together.\n\nPursued by ghosts, unable to appease or escape them, Dayan casts a spell over the reader, who, immersed in her mind-expanding world of spirits, blood, and dirt, songs and snakes, her mother and the South, wishes the story didn't have to end. And in a way it doesn't have to. Because of the vividness of its scenes and the power of its language, and because it thrusts us into realms not usually visited in memoir, it will go on my shelf for a while, and then, I know, it will come back to life, a revenant, just as alive the second or third time around as it was before.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 4, 19, 21, 23, 6, 12, 13], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 15, 21, 6, 4, 12, 13, 23, 19], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [19, 6, 21, 23, 4, 12, 5, 14, 13], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [5, 14, 12, 6, 21, 23, 19, 13, 4], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [23, 14, 5, 21, 12, 6, 4, 19, 15, 13], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]}}, "summary": "The Tottenham manager said yesterday that the players and staff felt \"empty\" after the match and it had since been a challenging start to the season.\nMeanwhile, Pochettino has warned that Tottenham's new signings, Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon, could need up to two years to produce their best.\n\"For me, when you sign a player, despite the amount you pay, you need minimum 1\u00bd or two years,\" Pochettino said.", "text": "Mauricio Pochettino has revealed his and his squad's concern at being filmed for an access-all-areas documentary this season, saying that he now feels like a \"producer\" as well as a football manager.\n\nIt was confirmed this month that Tottenham Hotspur would be the focus of the latest Amazon All or Nothing documentary, with cameras following the team and filming behind the scenes at the club.

A TEA is defined as a rural area or an area where the unemployment rate is at least 150% of the national average. The EB-5 program has delegated to states the authority to designate various TEAs on a project-specific basis. By locating a commercial enterprise in a state-designated TEA, foreign investors sharply reduce the size of investment that is needed to qualify for a green card. \n\nThe EB-5 regulations, which were written in 1990, take a geocentric approach to defining TEAs by assuming that an enterprise's employees live near its principle place of business. In 1990, this was not an unreasonable assumption. It is today. It is now common for American workers to physically commute to jobs that are located in different metropolitan areas and to cyber-commute to jobs anywhere in the country. Internet-based employment is an efficient means of providing economic opportunities to workers who live in rural America and areas of high unemployment. \n\nThe current TEA designation process has been the subject of criticism over concerns that the EB-5 investments are not helping the program's intended beneficiaries. In response to criticism and the passage of time, DHS is updating its EB-5 regulations. DHS's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking explains that the program's reliance \"on states' TEA designations has resulted in the application of inconsistent rules by different states. ... the deference to state determinations provided by current regulations has resulted in the acceptance of some TEAs that consist of areas of relative economic prosperity linked to areas with lower employment, and some TEAs that have been criticized as 'gerrymandered.'\" \n\nDHS's response to this concern is a proposal to (1) centralize TEA decisions in Washington and (2) create an even more georestrictive requirement for TEAs. The proposed rule does not consider Americans who could \"commute\" to work via the internet. In short, the proposed regulation doubles-down on the 1990 mindset that workers live near their place of employment, a faulty assumption that has helped fuel the \"gerrymandering\" issue. \n\nThere is no statutory requirement that new commercial enterprises be physically located in TEAs in order for investors to qualify for the TEA provisions of the EB-5 program. To the contrary, the statute states that investor visas \"shall be reserved for qualified immigrants who invest in a new commercial enterprise ... which will create employment in a targeted employment area.\" \n\nOne option for the EB-5 program would be to allow a new commercial enterprise to qualify for TEA EB-5 investment, irrespective of the business's location, by committing to hire workers who live in a designated TEA. By leveraging the internet, the EB-5 program could provide technology jobs to Americans who live in rural and high unemployment areas. \n\nBy Bruce Levinson, SVP, Regulatory Intervention - Center for Regulatory Effectiveness \n\nRelated topics: Law, Policy & Regulation\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [4, 19, 23, 12, 6, 5, 14, 13, 21], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 4, 13, 23, 5, 6, 14, 12, 21], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 12, 6, 4, 21, 19, 13, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [4, 21, 23, 12, 19, 13, 14, 5, 6], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [21, 13, 4, 23, 15, 12, 5, 14, 19, 6], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "The secretion of insulin is accompanied by the release of another molecule called IGF (insulin-like growth factor) whose role is to stimulate cell growth.\nThere is a good reason to believe the sugar rise in the blood contributes to the cancer epidemic, as it is linked to an explosion of insulin and IGF in our bodies.\nIn case of type II diabetes, the body cannot make efficient use of the insulin - a condition known as insulin resistance.", "text": "A major concern in the Indian scenario is the lack of awareness and knowledge on diabetes. Just like cancer, diabetes cannot be seen and in many cases have been developing and growing in your body for years without detection. Most people treat diabetes as a mild illness and fail to take care of it until it\u2019s too late. Thus often the two diseases are called \u2018silent killers\u2019. \u2018The two diseases also share certain risk factors, of which we cannot control certain factors such as age, family history and ethnicity, others are still manageable. Risk factors like obesity, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet and smoking also make you vulnerable to diseases and these can be controlled through well-timed intervention,\u2019 Dr Roshani Gadge, Consultant Diabetologist, Gadge Diabetes Center, Mumbai. \n\n\u2018An association between diabetes and cancer has been talked about for several years, but it is only in the recent past (about 10 years) that significant evidence has established the link between the two and has proved that insulin plays a crucial role here,\u2019 she opines. \n \nWhat makes us prone to diabetes? \n \nDr Roshni says, \u2018Almost 56 percent of our calories come from three sources that were non-existent when our genes were developing: \n Refined sugars (cane and beet sugar, corn, syrup, fructose, etc)  Bleached flour (white bread, white pasts, white rice, etc)  Vegetable oils (soybean, sunflower, corn, trans fats)  \nIt so happens that these three sources contain none of the proteins, vitamins, or omega-3 fatty acids needed to keep our bodies functioning. On the other hand, they directly fuel the growth of cancer. When we eat sugar or white flour \u2013 foods with a high glycemic index \u2013 blood glucose levels rise rapidly. The body immediately releases a dose of insulin to enable the glucose to enter cells. The secretion of insulin is accompanied by the release of another molecule called IGF (insulin-like growth factor) whose role is to stimulate cell growth. In short, sugar nourishes tissues and makes them grow faster. Furthermore, insulin and IGF have another effect in common: they promote the factors of inflammation which also stimulates cell growth and acts as a fertilizer for tumours to grow. \n \nThere is a good reason to believe the sugar rise in the blood contributes to the cancer epidemic, as it is linked to an explosion of insulin and IGF in our bodies. \n \nThe link between type II diabetes and risk of cancer \n \nIn case of type II diabetes, the body cannot make efficient use of the insulin \u2013 a condition known as insulin resistance. To compensate, the pancreas speeds up the production of insulin in your body. Consequently, insulin begins to build up in your bloodstream, which causes cells to divide, grow and spread \u2013 this may include cancerous cells, leading to the growth of a tumour. Those with Type 1 Diabetes have no insulin production at all and depend on artificially injected insulin, which can be more precisely controlled. \n \nStudies suggest that people with Diabetes (primarily Type 2) are associated with an increased risk of some cancers such as liver, pancreas, colon/rectum, breast and bladder cancers. Therefore, it is very important that you monitor and keep your blood sugar levels regulated. On the other hand, diabetes is also associated with a reduced risk for prostate cancer, some good news for men! \n \nImage source: Shutterstock \n Published: January 22, 2018 9"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [21, 5, 14, 4, 19, 13, 6, 23, 12], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [21, 14, 5, 19, 12, 23, 6, 13, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [23, 6, 12, 13, 21, 5, 19, 14, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [23, 12, 6, 14, 13, 5, 21, 19, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [14, 19, 13, 15, 4, 23, 6, 12, 5, 15, 21], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "For the 3rd edition of Viva Technology Paris, L'Or\u00e9al will present its latest beauty tech innovations at Viva Technology Paris, displaying how digital technologies enhance the future of beauty providing an \"augmented\" consumer experience.\n\"The New Beauty Experience\": Personalized digital products and services Visitors will be able to immerse themselves into new digital beauty experiences on a journey across three areas of daily life - a bathroom, a hair salon and a boutique.", "text": "For the 3rd edition of Viva Technology Paris, L\u2019Or\u00e9al will present its latest beauty tech innovations at Viva Technology Paris, displaying how digital technologies enhance the future of beauty providing an \u201caugmented\u201d consumer experience. \n \n\u201cThe New Beauty Experience\u201d: Personalized digital products and services \nVisitors will be able to immerse themselves into new digital beauty experiences on a journey across three areas of daily life \u2013 a bathroom, a hair salon and a boutique.

But Jennings, who actually shared the quote above in a recent interview with Ars, is smart enough to recognize that most people don't find the same joy in \"pure\" trivia tests that he does. \nARS TECHNICA \nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica , a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast. \n\n\"If trivia is just knowledge retrieval, it's only fun if you get it right,\" Jennings told Ars. \"It shouldn't just be middle-aged dads trading baseball statistics ... It can involve deduction and lateral thinking, different kinds of cognition other than, 'Do I remember this thing my 9th grade teacher taught me.' One is fun, the other is fun only to a very, very small group of people.\" \n\nRichard Garfield, the storied creator of Magic: The Gathering (and, more recently, Valve's Artifact ), came to a similar conclusion after reading Jennings' book, Brainiac . \"I was really taken by his love of trivia,\" Garfield said. \"I learned to see trivia as being more than just a black-or-white test of whether you know it or not. Good trivia questions have an art to them, and have many more dimensions.\" \n\nAnd so, a bit more than five years ago, Garfield reached out to Jennings to \"make a trivia game that really brought those elements out.\" Today, on Kickstarter , they're finally ready to unveil Half-Truth , their attempt to turn the world of trivia games on its ear. \n\nAs a game designer, Garfield's first task in making his own trivia game was to focus on the pain points that make standard trivia quizzes so unsatisfying for many.\n\"I thought back to my evenings playing trivia games, and I saw that one of the frustrating things was when I hit a long period of time where I knew nothing, or nothing that wasn't known by almost everyone there,\" Garfield said. \"Then the one question where I was a master at the subject, where I was the only person who knew, that question got asked to someone else. So right off the bat, I resolved that everybody should be answering every question.\" \n\nGarfield also decided to stick with multiple choice questions, so players would always have a potential \"hook\" that could provide some insight into the answer. After testing cards with one right answer out of six choices, though, Garfield says he \"moved to the much more interesting place\" where three out of the six options were correct (or \"half\" true). \n\nThat means, at worst, players have a 50 percent chance of stumbling on a right answer every time. And even if they don't know the answer, players can improve those chances by eliminating answers they know are wrong or looking for patterns and groupings in the options. \n\nGarfield gave an example from testing where a card asked players to identify which of the six options were types of mushrooms. The three wrong answers\u2014Destroying Angel, Blinding Angel, and Thallid\u2014were drawn from Magic: The Gathering cards (perhaps not surprisingly, as the question was written by Garfield's wife). \"This was sort of eye-opening for me; that was a clever way to make it so there were more angles into this card. If you know Magic cards real well, you don't need to know mushrooms at all.\" \n\nFor the \"trivia jocks\" who might play the game, there's also the option to push your luck and identify two or three answers. This gives you a slight bonus if you're correct but eliminates all of that turn's progress if you get even one choice wrong, introducing some basic risk-versus-reward strategy to the design. \n\nTrivia games are usually lopsided based on who just happens to know (and can retrieve) more trivial information from their brains. But Garfield says Half-Truth 's design \"gives you this start down an egalitarian path where everybody's got a chance,\" but without making the playing field completely flat. \n\n\"The people who aren't as trivia savvy will feel like they've got more of a chance,\" Garfield said. \"Maybe they won't win, but they'll have their victories. I often try to create my games so that skillful play is an advantage, but it doesn't mean you win every single time.\" \n\nThe hope is to make each question in Half-Truth a bit of a logic puzzle that can be solved, rather than a pure test of recall. \"Right in front of you [on each card] there are three right answers,\" Jennings pointed out. \"They are right there ... you're trying to solve the riddle, figure out which is which.\" \n\nJennings recalled winning the first Half-Truth test game he played with Garfield, after a year of development, and thinking, \"Yes, exactly, this is how the universe should work. I should win trivia games.\" When they played again, though, Jennings lost, \"and I thought, this is a very smart game, because sometimes the trivia expert has a small edge, but that's not always enough ... The result is it's the rare trivia game where you remember feeling smart when you play. \n\n\"People don't feel well-informed,\" Jennings added by way of explaining the paralysis many people feel around trivia games. \"We're a very information dense society today. And people feel like they don't know enough stuff. We're constantly feeling bad about the stuff that we know. \n\n\"The beauty of trivia is that opposite feeling, when something inside your head actually pays off,\" he continued. \"That's such an amazing epiphany because it happens so rarely. We spend all this effort stuffing facts into out head, then occasionally, at a trivia board, something turns into real life points and it's delightful. Half-Truth is structured to give more people that experience.\" \n\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica ."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [6, 12, 14, 5, 4, 13, 21, 23, 19], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [13, 12, 4, 21, 6, 23, 5, 14, 19], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [21, 23, 14, 5, 19, 13, 12, 4, 6], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [19, 14, 5, 6, 4, 13, 21, 12, 23], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 4, 12, 6, 13, 19, 21, 23, 5, 14, 15], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4]}}, "summary": "Under the direction of Rottet Studio, the redesign eyes to honor our city's design history.\nThe enhancements are slated for completion in October.\nThe hotel lobby will be completely transformed and reconfigured to emphasize a sense of arrival and welcome.", "text": "The Ritz-Carlton, Los Angeles started an enhancement project, the largest in the property\u2019s 10-year history. \n\nUnder the direction of Rottet Studio, the redesign eyes to honor our city\u2019s design history, especially the influence of Art Deco to the downtown Los Angeles landscape. \n\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Los Angeles has launched the largest renovation in the property\u2019s 10-year history. \n\nThe project will include a full redesign of the hotel lobby, and will extend to all of the hotel\u2019s 123 guestrooms and suites, corridors and the Club Lounge. \n\nUnder the direction of Rottet Studio, the redesign eyes to honor our city\u2019s design history, especially the influence of Art Deco to the downtown Los Angeles landscape.

Following is the statement made by H.E. Ambassador Reza Najafi at the Board of Governors of IAEA on \n\nIsraeli Nuclear Capabilities:\n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nIn line with the NAM position, the issue of Israeli nuclear capability was raised by distinguished ambassador of Kuwait on behalf of Arab Group, and while sharing their concerns on the issue, I would like to restate the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran as follows: \n\nThe Israeli nuclear capability with the exclusive military purpose has always been a source of serious concern for the peoples of the region and international community. The Heads of State or Government of the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM) in the Final Document of its 16th Summit expressed concern over the acquisition of nuclear capability by Israel, which poses a serious and continuing threat to the security of neighboring and other States. \n\nThey also condemned it for continuing to develop and stockpile nuclear arsenals. In the same document, they \u201creiterated their support for the efforts of the Arab Group in Vienna to keep the question of the Israeli nuclear capabilities under consideration\u201d at the IAEA. They urged that the continued consideration of this issue in the context of the IAEA is completely relevant. \n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nSince 1982, the IAEA has passed several resolutions, made decisions and called upon this regime to promptly accede to the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and put all of its clandestine nuclear facilities under the Agency\u2019s full scope safeguards. Furthermore, the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference recalled \u201cthe reaffirmation by the 2000 Review Conference of the importance of Israel\u2019s accession to the Treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards'. \n\nIgnoring the legitimate international concerns by refraining to adhere to the NPT, this regime with blind support of some countries, continuously advances its unlawful nuclear capabilities with the hidden involvement of certain States, in flagrant breach of all international norms and regulations. \n\nContrary to the statement made by the then Prime Minister of Israel on 11 December 2006, related to the possession of nuclear weapons by Israel which was strongly condemned by NAM, when asked by CNN, in a clear lie its current prime minister denied having nuclear weapons. It is crystal clear that clandestine nuclear weapon program of this regime not only jeopardizes the regional and global security but also seriously undermines the Agency\u2019s verification mechanism.\n\nAs it was also called by the NAM, there must be the total and complete prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material and facilities, resources or devices and the extension of assistance in the nuclear related scientific or technological fields to Israel. \n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran expresses its deep concern over the serious negative implications on security in the region as well as the reliability of the global non-proliferation regime whereby Israeli scientists are generously provided access to the nuclear facilities of certain Nuclear Weapon States (NWSs) where they gathered thousands of pages of documents on development of nuclear weapons. \n\nSuch access has been provided to scientists of a non-party to the NPT with an underground nuclear military program while nuclear scientists of NPT Parties have been assassinated all over the Middle East by terrorists recruited by this regime. Nuclear weapons in the hands of such regime with a history full of aggression, occupation and state-terrorism is a real threat to the international peace and security. \n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nThe failure of the NPT 2015 Review Conference due to the position of 3 countries, in support of a non-party to the NPT is a serious setback and regrettable. States Parties to the Treaty, in the first and second sessions of the Preparatory Committee of upcoming NPT Review Conference, held respectively in May 2017 here in Vienna and in April 2018 in Geneva, expressed their concern on such failure. \n\nTherefore, my delegation is of the view that pending the materialization of the international community\u2019s call for the adherence of Israel to the NPT without any condition and placement of all its clandestine nuclear facilities under the full-scope safeguards of the IAEA, it is quite reasonable that the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities, as a real threat to the international peace and security remains on the agenda of the IAEA.\n\nReporter: Hadi Nadri\n\n1396**1396\n\nFollow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [5, 13, 21, 19, 4, 23, 6, 12, 14], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [13, 4, 14, 21, 5, 19, 23, 6, 12], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [23, 6, 4, 14, 13, 12, 19, 21, 5], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 12, 13, 21, 5, 19, 14, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [12, 5, 21, 14, 4, 15, 23, 6, 13, 19], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Former England defender Gary Neville suggested Gareth Southgate ' s squad had done more than could have been expected of them at this World Cup.\nIvan Perisic and Mario Mandzukic goals earned Croatia a date with France after a 2 - 1 extra - time win in Moscow.\nNeville : \" This team has taken us to a place we never imagined we could get \"\nEngland ' s Dejan Lovren and Domagoj Vida were sent off in the second half.\nDefender Rio Ferdinand says experience was a telling factor in the England squad.\nEngland face France in the World Cup final in Brazil.", "text": "Mario Mandzukic pounces to fire the ball past Jordan Pickford and put Croatia into the World Cup final.

Photo: Reuters   \nFormer England defender Rio Ferdinand believes the youthful nature of England's squad proved to be their undoing in the semi-final. \n \n\"I think experience was a telling factor today,\" Ferdinand told the BBC. \"This Croatian team had medals all over the squad but now is not the time to knitpick. This bunch of players have brought the nation together and the fans haven't sung like this for years. \n \n\"We wanted this team to come out with an identity and a philosophy of playing, and I think they have done that. Where we were sat in the stadium, people around us were impressed with England's football and their ability to play out from the back. \n \n\"Kieran Trippier's delivery of the ball was brilliant and what a tournament he has had. There were question marks over Jordan Pickford but he was the best choice in goal and this team can develop into something very strong. I have been an admirer of John Stones for a long time, and he defended unbelievably today. We have got a very inexperienced young squad but they have grown and will continue to do so.\" \n \nEx-England striker Alan Shearer also tried to find the positives amid England's anguish. \n \n\"We said before the tournament that if they gave absolutely everything in every game, everyone at home would be happy,\" said Shearer. \n \n\"England got off to a very good start and dominated the first 45 minutes but Croatia stepped 10 yards further forward in the second half. \n \n\"Luka Modric bossed the midfield and we could not get near him with his deft touches and passes, he was superb and a man of the match performance, a vital cog for them. We lacked experience to get someone on him and stop him. Croatia did not panic when they fell behind. \n \n\"Kieran Trippier was brilliant in the tournament and so was Jordan Pickford, especially with his delivery. Harry Kane was a bit quiet in the knockout games and he had a chance that he could not put away \n \n\"So many positives to take out of the tournament, we did not expect to get to the quarters and will go home after this without heads held high. Finishing third would be excellent.

With USD 142 billion net worth, Bezos tops the ranking of richest persons, according to\u00a0 Bloomberg Billionaires Index .\u00a0 \n \nAccording to a CNBC report , Amazon\u2019s customer base has remained loyal through the latest Prime price hike in exchange for a slew of services and perks, and the company\u2019s stock has continued to increase in value. Since June 1, the tech titan\u2019s net worth has grown over $5 billion and now totals $141.9 billion, according to the Forbes World\u2019s Billionaires list. That makes Bezos worth roughly $49 billion more than Bill Gates and about $60 billion more than Warren Buffett. \n \nEarlier this year, Bezos officially became the richest person in the world and also helped make Amazon the second most valuable company in the world, behind Apple. His success can arguably be traced back to a risk he took when he was 30 years old, when Bezos was a high school student and the class valedictorian, and he got accepted via early admission to Princeton, according to Brad Stone\u2019s biography \u201cThe Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.\u201d He majored in computer science and electrical engineering, and then went on to work various finance and tech jobs after college. \n \nIt was while serving as a vice president at the hedge fund D. E. Shaw in the 1990s that Bezos came up with the idea to sell books over the Internet. Doing so, though, would mean taking a significant risk and perhaps sacrificing his stable job. Experts believe the\u00a0Amazon CEO is here to play to long game, and it is here for everyone to see as Bezos is remaking the world with its business acumen and operational prowess. \n \nThere are a number of things Amazon has taken in its strides, where his rivals falter.\u00a0The\u00a0 2017 Walker Sands Future of Retail \u00a0study found 84% of US consumers have made a purchase on Amazon in the past year, and 55% are Prime subscribers. Consumers are increasingly using other Amazon offerings too, like voice devices (16%), grocery (14% - Pantry, 10% - Fresh) and Dash buttons (5%). \n \nAlso Millennials love Amazon.\u00a0According to Yes Lifecycle Marketing\u2019s report \u201c A Marketer\u2019s Guide to Reaching Each Consumer Generation ,\u201d nearly four in five (79%) millennials have purchased from Amazon in the past month, and 55% shop at Amazon for the Prime benefits \u2014 more than any other generation. \n \nThe next in line is Bill Gates with USD 94.2 billion. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, the world\u2019s biggest software maker, owns about 1 per cent of the Redmond, Washington-based company.\u00a0Gates, the man who made Microsoft is more of an executor than a visionary. Rather than merely innovating or dreaming, Gates took a disciplined approach toward software as a potential source of business opportunities. \n \n\u201cAs we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others, said Gates. \n \nAs a leader his leadership style has a mixture of autocratic, visionary and participative approaches. He is actively involved in technology development for new products and in making various strategic decisions. He spends most of his time for staying touch with customers and employees around the world. He expects his managers to have their own personal influence and to take decisions assuming they are the CEO of the organization which showed the participative leadership style. \u00a0 \n \nBill Gates sees and thinks differently than most people do.\u00a0 David Aston, who worked with Gates mentions in his blog that gates has an amazing ability to find the flaws, or see opportunities, or connect the dots.\u00a0 He can zoom in to details with precision or zoom out to the big picture.\u00a0 He can flip back in time or fast forward to the future.\u00a0 He also has the ability to focus on the merits of the idea or innovation before worrying about the business case.\u00a0 Chances are, you could benefit from Bill\u2019s thinking skills, even if it simply means getting a new perspective on your problems.\u00a0 \n \nLike a true entrepreneur, Gates saw the \u201cstructural holes\u201d in the personal computing marketplace and moved in to occupy them, always in a subordinate spot to the big players. His method was: \u2018Act strategically, partner powerfully\u2019, which made him different from most others. \n \nFacebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg with USD 81.6 billion net worth has become the third richest person on the globe. He has overtaken Warren Buffett to sit at the third position in the global ranking of richest persons. Buffett is the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway. He has given away massive wealth to charity. Once the wealthiest person, Buffett is sliding in rank thanks to his charity work. Since 2006, Buffett has donated 290 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to charity, most of them to Gates\u2019 foundation. Those shares are worth more than $50bn now. \n \nAs per Bloomberg estimates, Zuckerberg now trail only Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates. According to a Fortune report, investors love Facebook more than ever. Investors are also happy at the news that Facebook has grabbed its biggest sports streaming deal yet with the Premier League. \n \nThe Times reported that Facebook has won exclusive rights to show all 380 live matches in parts of S.E Asia from 2019 until 2022, in a deal worth about $264 million. Since going public in 2012, Facebook has seen its stock rise more than 400 per cent.

These companies are of US origin. However, they conduct their businesses globally and therefore earn significant revenue from markets abroad. \n \nUS Tech companies prefer keeping their foreign revenue in offshore tax havens for obvious reasons. America is known for its high tax rates. \n \nTech companies have to distribute dividends. Some of those companies roll out \u201cshare buyback\u201d schemes. Others have different types of financial commitments to meet. Executing these activities requires Billions of US Dollars. From an investors\u2019 point of view, a question that arises is how exactly these companies meet their financial obligations in the US while their funds are parked outside of the US. \n \nThe financial industry facilitates these tech companies to meet their financial obligations. The common man is however not aware of the financial wizardry involved. \n \nTech companies over the years issued corporate bonds in the American debt market to meet their financing needs. The interest amount paid/to be paid on account of sales of these bonds was less as compared to tax liability on funds parked abroad, if they ever were repatriated. Over the period of time, these tech companies became \u201clarge corporate bond sellers\u201d. Bloomberg named them \u201cnon-financial borrowers\u201d. \n \nBusiness Insider (UK) reported in April 2018 that \u201cApple has the largest cash pile ($261 billion) amongst US companies\u201d. It further said that \u201ca large chunk of that cash pile is stashed overseas (out of the USA)\u201d. As per Bloomberg (31 August, 2018), Apple has accumulated corporate debt of more than $150 billion. \n \nRather than focusing on any specific company, let\u2019s study the overall impact of these tech companies on the US economy. \n \nBefore Trump administration, tech companies were continuing with their strategy of corporate bond sales and were piling up US debt market to meet their cash flow requirements (e.g. acquisitions, share buybacks, shareholder payouts etc.). The recent tax overhaul, made by Trump administration incentivised these Tech companies to repatriate their funds to USA. \n \nBloomberg reports (on 31 August, 2018) that after the revision of tax regulations, tech companies have repatriated $306 billion from abroad. \u201cStrategas Securities\u201d, a US based brokerage and advisory firm estimates that the total amount could reach\u00a0 $700 billion by end of the year (2018). \n \nImpact of Repatriation \n \nWith funds in hand, most of the tech giants intend to \u201cbuyback\u201d their shares. For an existing shareholder, the share buyback is like a dividend payout, albeit more attractive. The companies benefit from it because decreased supply of its shares in the equity market raises its share price, a simple application of demand and supply theory. \n \nThe following example makes it simple to understand the financial benefit of \u201cshare buyback\u201d. (Please note that rates and amounts given are for example purposes). \n \nFunds repatriated from abroad, if invested in Treasury bills \u2013\u00a0 $100 @ 2% equals to $2. \n \nPayout to shareholders who hold shares worth the $100 @ 10% equals to $10 \n \nThe resulting economic value is \u201cnegative\u201d ($8). \n \nTherefore, if $100 worth of shares are \u201cbought back\u201d from shareholders, it will result in significant savings. \n \nIt is very easy to comprehend that repatriated excess funds, if utilised for \u201cshare buyback\u201d, will save money for these tech giants long term. Hoarding cash now is not wise. In fact, the savings can be utilised to pay corporate debt liabilities as and when they become due. \n \nUS corporate debt market was significantly influenced by these \u201cnon-financial borrowers\u201d. In coming years it will see a significant decline in sales of corporate bonds. The economic pundits are working on different probable outcomes that might result due to sudden cash influx caused by tech giants. By end of this year, actual position will surface out and future direction of the US corporate debt market will be set."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [21, 19, 23, 6, 4, 12, 14, 13], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [21, 23, 6, 13, 4, 14, 19, 12], "scores": [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [21, 23, 12, 14, 19, 4, 13, 6], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [12, 14, 13, 23, 6, 19, 21, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 21, 14, 13, 12, 15, 19, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "President Trump sent shock waves through the mainstream media on Tuesday by attacking Sen.

It\u2019s associated with memory, family, coming together.

He said Lelkes' work focused on bone regeneration using fabrics made from cytosine, one of the bases found in DNA. \n \n\"What he found was that suddenly he had an ability to lay these fabrics on holes drilled in skulls of mice, and they could heal them,\" Gerstenhaber said. \"(The holes were) big enough that they wouldn't (normally) heal on a mouse.\" \n  \nWhen Gerstenhaber saw the presentation, he started to think about individualizing dental and jaw implants, many of which are standardized. \n \n\"All of their implants were either flat, or perfectly round, something they could do without having a complicated robot do it for them because they were limited,\" Gerstenhaber said. \"(Prosthetic companies) couldn't make any realistic examples of any of these use scenarios because the tools didn't exist.\" \n \n\u00a0 \n \nBranching off from Lelkes' project, Gerstenhaber wanted to develop a flexible bandage for serious wounds that would not only stop bleeding, but also quickly regenerate the skin. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\"I was like, 'Wow, I'm making this tool to make my life easier, but it's going to open this whole new avenue of research,'\" Gerstenhaber said. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nHis bandages are made with a soy protein, which helps tissue heal faster than it would if covered by a conventional bandage. The technique is being researched in labs within the College of Engineering. The participating scientists are testing the bandages to ensure they have the capability of helping external tissue regenerate. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWhen applied with water, the white bandages adhere to the skin in an almost invisible fashion. Then, when the patient moves, the bandage moves with them, almost as though it were part of their skin. \n \n\u00a0 \n  \n\"We've mainly been looking at burns, and the sorts of wounds that don't heal well, and when they heal, they sort of heal like very bad skin,\" Gerstenhaber said. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nSome other bioengineering professors, as well as undergraduate and graduate students, have contributed to the project under the supervision of Lelkes and bioengineering professor Yah-el Har-el. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nBaran Arig, a sophomore bioengineering major, started working on the bandage project as a freshman. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nArig, who conducted research on electrospinning in high school, said he wanted to continue his study of the technology. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\"For the most part, what I am doing is I am making a viscous solution for the electrospinner,\" Arig said. \"I am spinning these solutions to create these electrospun scaffolds that can be looked at through a microscope.\" \n \n\u00a0 \n \nIn addition to the main printing prototype, Gerstenhaber and his colleagues have also constructed a modified, handheld version of the 3D printer. The handheld printer is closer to being ready for market than the full-size 3D printer. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nThe larger version is still undergoing some alterations to improve its efficiency. Personalizing the bandages requires a time-consuming scan of the targeted area. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nGerstenhaber said he hopes that in the future, the handheld model will become a household staple, but for now he and his team are focused on bringing it to market. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nWhile Gerstenhaber recognizes all medical devices, like physical implants or skin grafts, are important, he said tissue regeneration is the greatest solution to healing wounds. \n \n\u00a0 \n \n\"If I can allow your body to heal itself, that's really the best thing I can give to you,\" Gerstenhaber said. \"Especially if that healing is natural and is complete.\""}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [5, 14, 4, 12, 15, 21, 23, 6, 13, 19], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [13, 23, 12, 21, 6, 5, 14, 19, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [4, 6, 13, 14, 12, 19, 5, 21, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [5, 21, 14, 19, 4, 12, 6, 23, 13], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 21, 13, 5, 12, 6, 14, 4, 15, 23, 19], "scores": [0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "A big concern of Johnson's and one of the most popular ways fires have started in the community is the use of space heaters in the home.\nWhile you might want to keep your home warm even while your away, it's advised to turn off all heating sources, excluding the home's heating system.\nAnother tip is to frequently check fire alarms and smoke detectors to be sure both are working properly.", "text": "As the community starts to experience colder temperatures, residents are trying to stay as warm as possible.

He added that people should not use fuel-burning space heaters in a confined space and encouraged everyone to use them outdoors rather than inside. \n\nWhile you might want to keep your home warm even while your away, it's advised to turn off all heating sources, excluding the home's heating system. \n\nsee fire/page a6 \n\nJohnson said, when trying to keep warm using a fireplace, it's important to make sure everything is working properly and appropriately contained. \n\n\"(For anyone that does have a fireplace), they definitely want get their chimneys cleaned and checked to make sure there's no cracks or leaks,\" he said. \n\n\"If they have a gas fireplace, make sure the connections are leak free and the equipment is working properly.

I am sure about this. \n\nConte on Musonda \n\nChelsea boss Antonio Conte tells Charly Musonda his chance will come. \n\n\"He has to continue to work in this way and for sure the opportunity will come. Charly could have a good opportunity this season to play because we only have three No 10s: Hazard, Willian and Pedro. Usually two No 10s play, so this season could be good for him to show that he deserves to play.\" \n\nWith Willian struggling for form, there are Chelsea supporters who feel the youngster already deserves a first Premier League start. While there are concerns about his slender frame even at the age of 21, Musonda offered enough in 25 minutes against Crystal Palace to suggest he is a viable alternative to the out-of-sorts Brazilian. The potential is obvious. \n\nMusonda came on as a substitute for Chelsea against Crystal Palace \n\nSpeaking to Chelsea's former academy coach Adi Viveash in the summer, it was clear that he is a huge admirer of Musonda. The player was part of the team that won the FA Youth Cup and the UEFA Youth League under Viveash in 2015 with the coach recalling his \"individual brilliance\" and a group of players who \"had everything\". Even so, the wait goes on. \n\n\"Everyone can be critical and have their own opinion about players getting through to the first team at Chelsea,\" said Viveash. \"It has been discussed so many times. But there is only one man who picks the Chelsea first team and that's the manager. That is it. \n\n\"It does not mean players are not ready because I am 100 per cent convinced that over the past five years there have been players who were ready to play in Chelsea's first team. That is a discussion for someone else. If they cannot play there and they are good enough then they have to go and play somewhere else.\" \n\nRay Wilkins believes Chelsea's squad is weaker than when they won the title \n\nRay Wilkins believes Chelsea's squad is weaker than when they won the title \n\nThat is the conclusion that Musonda's long-time team-mate Dominic Solanke made in the summer. Nathaniel Chalobah did the same. The latter will miss out on a return to Stamford Bridge with Watford on Saturday due to injury but he can feel vindicated nevertheless having already made five times as many starts for the Hornets as he made for Chelsea. \n\nCoincidentally, Chalobah, like Solanke, could well have featured more regularly had he stayed given Chelsea's recent injury crisis. N'Golo Kante and Danny Drinkwater are missing in midfield, while first-choice striker Alvaro Morata has only just returned following a hamstring problem. Conte has been open about his frustrations. \n\nChelsea vs Watford \n\nOctober 21, 2017, 11:30am \n\nLive on \n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \n\n\"The situation is difficult,\" he said in midweek. \"We have to play every three days and it is not simple. Also because, in this moment, we are thin we have to play always the same players.\" Summer target Radja Nainggolan lined up for opponents Roma on Wednesday and the Chelsea boss clearly wishes the club had added more depth to the squad in the summer. \n\nAnd yet, there remains an alternative. The option is there to trust in the talents of the country's most successful academy of the past decade. To give the gifted young players at Stamford Bridge the chance to play some Premier League football. Musonda will be waiting to see that team sheet against Watford.

The licenses will cost $24 for four years and $48 for eight years. \n\nWhile the new IDs are mostly for the state to come into compliance with federal law, Avery said that for anyone in Calloway County who doesn\u2019t have plans to board a plane or visit a federal facility, a standard driver\u2019s license should suffice for their needs. She said more information on what is needed to acquire a normal license, or voluntary travel ID can be found at drive.ky.gov .\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [21, 12, 5, 4, 14, 23, 6, 13, 19], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [6, 13, 4, 14, 12, 19, 5, 23, 21], "scores": [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [14, 21, 12, 19, 4, 23, 5, 6, 13], "scores": [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [13, 15, 21, 19, 15, 6, 12, 4, 23, 5, 14], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [6, 13, 19, 15, 21, 5, 14, 23, 4, 12], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Prop Joe Moody returns from two - match suspension against the Chiefs on Saturday night.\nBoth were suspended for striking Waratah Kurtley Beale off the ball earlier this month.\nProp Owen Franks and hooker Codie Taylor have also been suspended for two weeks.\nProp was accused of being a dirty player by some after he struck Beale.\nThe Crusaders should know by Tuesday or Wednesday if captain Sam Whitelock and midfielder Ryan Crotty have recovered from their concussions.\nThe Crusaders beat the Waratahs 31 - 29 this month.\nThe Crusaders face the Chiefs in the final on Saturday.", "text": "Crusaders prop Joe Moody returns from his two-match suspension against the Chiefs on Saturday night. \n   \nJason Ryan has got a message for those who believe Joe Moody and Owen Franks are dirty players - buck up your ideas.\u00a0 \n \nThe Crusaders' assistant coach has read it and heard it all since the\u00a0props returned from shoulder and Achilles injuries respectively,\u00a0only for both to be promptly\u00a0suspended for two weeks for striking.\u00a0 \n \nWhether it was from trolls hiding behind their keyboards, Australian media, or\u00a0bleated\u00a0from rugby heads over\u00a0a pint at their local tavern, many used the words \"dirty\" and \"cheat\" with the props' names in recent weeks.\u00a0 \n   \nProp Owen Franks and hooker Codie Taylor, pictured training with Crusaders assistant coach Jason Ryan. \n   \nGiven Moody, who was banned for striking Waratah Kurtley Beale off the ball, will return against the Chiefs on Saturday night, it would be naive to think there won't be juiced up hecklers in the Hamilton crowd prepared to take a\u00a0shot at the Crusaders' loose head. \n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n\"[Moody] was probably better than I was,\" Ryan said when asked how the All Black reacted to the criticism flung his way in the aftermath of the Crusaders' 31-29 win against the Waratahs earlier this month.\u00a0 \n   \nJoe Moody, pictured second from right, playing against the Waratahs earlier this month, was accused of being a dirty player by some after he struck Kurtley Beale off the ball in the match. \n   \n\"When people come out and say they're dirty players, I don't think they understand the game, to be honest.

The famed front-of-house engineer has a point: That resume is packed with work for such hallowed acts as Aerosmith, Whitesnake, the Cult, Foreigner, Creedence Clearwater Revival, along supergroups like Velvet Revolver and Kings of Chaos. (Boldface names along the lines of Lady Gaga and Enrique Iglesias fill up the rest.) Working with that kind of talent is one of the perks of being one of the best in the FOH business. \n \nBut like many, Kimball\u2019s original plan was to be one of those rock & roll stars himself. \u201cI was a musician first,\u201d he says, \u201cbut just by having to be my own sound guy, I started to fall in love by twisting knobs. At some point, I realized I couldn\u2019t really make a living and support my family by playing in a band\u2014but I realized I could do that by doing sound for bands. So I just bounced over, and one band just kind of led to another.\u201d \n \nThis summer, that path has led to a gig with Tears for Fears, who are on an arena tour co-headlining with another pair of \u201980s superstars, Hall & Oates. It\u2019s not Kimball\u2019s first go-round with the British pop-rock icons. \u201cI\u2019ve been working with Tears for Fears for years,\u201d he says, \u201cand the main reason is that I just really love their music. For a sound guy, it\u2019s really rare to be working with a band like that. With them, it\u2019s like mixing a record in a studio every day. These guys are just phenomenal\u2014and they\u2019re great human beings on top of that.\u201d \n \nGiven his status in the FOH universe, Kimball could probably get his hands on any piece of gear he wants. But when he recently was in the market for a preamp, he made the decision to incorporate Focusrite\u2019s ISA 828 eight-channel microphone preamp into his arsenal. \u201cI was searching around for preamps,\u201d he says \u201csomething I could use in a rack setup. I was looking at Neve, but the cost and the fact that they weren\u2019t built in a rack style meant that wasn\u2019t ideal; I didn\u2019t want to be physically stacking those boxes all the time. Then I came across the 828, saw that it had eight channels of Focusrite pres in a 2U rack space, and said, \u2018Okay, let me check this out.\u2019\u201d \n \nNeedless to say, Kimball liked what he found, and quickly added the ISA 828 to his set-up. \u201cI thought it would be a good idea to incorporate a splitter, set it up so that everything went into the 828s first, and then slid out to both monitors and front of house,\u201d he explains \u201cThat way, we were all getting the preamp sound. And we can get the best of both worlds\u2014we get analog on the front end, and then we can still have the conveniences of the digital world, with recall and all that. I\u2019ll tell you, when we started rehearsals, my jaw was on the ground, like \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of this a long time ago?\u201d The monitor guy, who\u2019s been working with Tears for Fears for four years himself, was the same: \u2018Why didn\u2019t we do this years ago?\u2019\u201d \n \nA major factor leading to Kimball\u2019s adoption of the ISA 828 was the preamp\u2019s tonal quality. Befitting his love for classic sounds, he fell in love with the luxurious richness that the unit offers\u2014which, as it happens, is based on a design created by Rupert Neve in 1985 for Sir George Martin\u2019s AIR Studios. \u201cThe 828 just warmed everything up, and gave me tones I hadn\u2019t heard for years, bringing in those second and third harmonic tones,\u201d he says. \u201cSpecifically with Tears for Fears, the bass tone had always been a bit thin and clanky. So what I tried was to bring in a diaphragm microphone to replace what we had been using, then put the Focusrite pres on both channels\u2014and it completely changed the sound of that bass. It sounded so warm. I thought, there it is! That\u2019s the sound I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d \n \nThat attention to sound quality is what makes Kimball one of the most in-demand FOH engineers around\u2014but what really keeps him going is the thrill of the show itself. \u201cThe studio thing doesn\u2019t float my boat,\u201d he admits. You can be sitting there all day working on a kick drum. \u201cWhat I like is the adrenaline of a live show, when the house is dark and things are about to start and you\u2019re thinking, okay\u2014time to make it happen. The energy is great; the vibe is great. The thing about live music is it\u2019s only that one night. You\u2019re never going to hear it the same exact way again, and I love that.\u201d"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [13, 12, 6, 23, 5, 19, 14, 21, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [21, 14, 5, 13, 4, 19, 12, 6, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 14, 21, 5, 23, 6, 12, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 4, 13, 14, 21, 5, 12, 19], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [12, 5, 4, 15, 19, 13, 14, 21, 6, 23, 15], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Cambridge University students lined the river Cam to celebrate exams.\nMore than 2 , 000 people gathered to watch the cardboard boat race.\nBoats were made out of cardboard , glue and duct tape.", "text": "Cambridge University students have lined the river Cam to celebrate the end of their exams by causing chaos on the city\u2019s waterways. \n \nMore than 2,000 people gathered to watch the annual cardboard boat race on what has been dubbed \u2018Suicide Sunday\u2019. \n \nThe day is the early Sunday after the end-of-year exams, and has been known to see a number of students enjoy the alcohol-fuelled celebrations. \n \nThis morning, 20 teams spent their time meticulously designing, making and sailing their boats, which were made out of cardboard, glue and as much duct tape as they could use. \n \nEach vessel was cleverly designed, with one poking fun at the Brexit battle bus which travelled up and down the country in the run up to the 2016 referendum. \n         \nIngenious students dubbed it \u2018Boat Leave\u2019 and they tried to up their speed by constructing paddles from Frisbees on a stick. \n     \n \nAnother competitor called her vessel \u2018Daddy\u2019s Yacht\u2019, seemingly poking fun at some of the more wealthy Cambridge University attendees. \n \nBut despite the clever designs, the flimsy boats soon succumbed to the water and crumbled in the water. \n \nEven those who were not involved in the race itself joined in the festivities, and many leapt into the river to splash around and enjoy the afternoon. \n         \nThe aim of the race is to make it from the historic Jesus Green to Magdalene Bridge. \n \nThe weekend is famed for its drinking and parties, as by this time students have finished exams but do not yet know the results. \n \nMany students are then left in a period of suspense, unaware of what their future will hold, and elect to blow off some steam with a full calendar of events."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [14, 21, 23, 13, 6, 4, 5, 12, 19], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 15, 12, 21, 5, 4, 14, 15, 23, 13, 6], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [14, 15, 19, 12, 5, 13, 23, 21, 6, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [23, 13, 12, 5, 21, 14, 4, 6, 19], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [12, 15, 21, 5, 13, 19, 23, 6, 15, 14, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "The UX will compete with BMW X1 and X2 , Audi Q2 and Q3 , Volvo XC40 and Jaguar E - Pace.\nInitial impressions are that it ' s a good alternative to the old CT hatchback.\nUX 250h is an AWD hybrid with the electric motor over the rear axle and total output of 178 HP.\nLook for 0 to 100 kph ( 62 mph ) in 8 . 5 seconds and decent fuel economy around town.", "text": "The Lexus US is already going on same in America, but Europe will have to wait until 2019 to get its hands on its first small luxury hybrid crossover from Japan.   14 photos     Thus, the Paris Motor Show debut is just a preview.

He talks proudly about once high-fiving Rudy Ruettiger, the former Notre Dame walk-on famous for sacking a quarterback during the final seconds of the only game of his college career. Mr. Ruettiger\u2019s story was the basis of the 1993 movie \u201cRudy.\u201d\n\nIt is no coincidence that Mr. Mulroy\u2019s Shih Tzu is named Rudy.\n\nIt is no wonder that Mr. Mulroy\u2019s wife, Linda, says, \u201cI feel like my whole world revolves around Notre Dame.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Mulroy never graduated from Notre Dame. He did not even attend Notre Dame.\n\nMr. Mulroy, a retired New York City police detective, is what Notre Dame calls a \u201csubway alum,\u201d someone who roots for Notre Dame but does not have a Notre Dame diploma. The term \u201csubway alums\u201d was coined a century ago, when Notre Dame played some away games in New York. Now Notre Dame uses the term for people who aren\u2019t graduates of the school but are involved in alumni affairs nationally, including those in places that do not have subways.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame Club of Staten Island has 43 members who graduated from the school, \u201cbut our total membership is over 160 because of guys like me\u201d and parents of undergraduates, said Joseph Delaney, a former club president who graduated in 1967 from Seton Hall University, which has not had a varsity football team since 1981.\n\nNotre Dame\u2019s president, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, said fans who didn\u2019t graduate from the school but who go to Notre Dame tailgate parties and games, collect Notre Dame memorabilia and conduct community service projects are \u201cunique.\u201d Subway alums are so important to the school that Mr. Delaney was recently named the first non-alumnus on Notre Dame\u2019s alumni board of directors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen schools like Texas or Michigan that are larger and nationally known that have fan bases,\u201d Chase Carter, president of the Council of Alumni Marketing and Membership Professionals who is also an official at Oklahoma State University\u2019s alumni association, said. \u201cBut nothing like this.\u201d\n\nThe rise of the subway alums coincided with Notre Dame\u2019s desire for its football team to be recognized nationally, which is why it scheduled games in New York.\n\nBut there was more to Notre Dame during that era than football. The team\u2019s fame \u201ccoincided with the immigrant wave and an anti-immigrant attitude and a little bit of anti-Catholic attitude,\u201d Father Jenkins said. \u201cIt became the team of this immigrant population, this group that was new to this country.\u201d Also, he added, \u201cNotre Dame scored a few stunning upsets. That helped.\u201d\n\nFather Jenkins said his father hooked him on watching Notre Dame games when he was growing up in Wisconsin. \u201cIt became your identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYour teams when you\u2019re 13 are the teams you root for, for life. It\u2019s associated with memory, family, coming together. It has this resonance that goes beyond the sport.\u201d\n\nFor many around the country, Notre Dame represented something bigger than a school or a team. \u201cMy dad was an Irish-Catholic blue collar man who took great pride in what Notre Dame stood for,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cIt was a matter of pride to my dad that the football players graduated, became doctors, became lawyers and some of them became clergy, but Notre Dame football gave them entry into the American mainstream. Guys like my dad who didn\u2019t go to college identified with that.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulroy \u2014 who graduated from The College of Staten Island \u2014 said he\u2019d often put the Notre Dame game on the radio during his police shift. \"In between calls, in between any situations, you always had the Notre Dame game on,\u201d he said.\n\nOnce, he and his partner, while off duty, went to a Giants-Jets game and heard the Notre Dame fight song among the tailgaters in the parking lot. The two ended up joining the tailgate and were introduced to Joe Nagy, the sheriff of St. Joseph County, Ind., home to Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cHe was introduced to us as the sheriff of Notre Dame,\u201d Mr. Mulroy said. \u201cI said, \u2018Sure, you\u2019re the sheriff of Notre Dame like I\u2019m the sheriff of Nottingham Forest.\u2019\u201d They became fast friends.\n\nNew York has produced more than subway alums for Notre Dame, of course. \u201cThe first-ever Notre Dame Heisman Trophy candidate was from Staten Island,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cWilliam Shakespeare. I kid you not. Notre Dame\u2019s quarterback in 1935. He finished third in the Heisman Trophy. And you know what? He was a Protestant.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulroy has attended home games in Indiana, making friends with tailgaters from South Bend and reciprocating, with help from a caterer, when Notre Dame played in the New York area and Fighting Irish fans came east. Mr. Mulroy\u2019s daughter Cara, who went to Catholic University in Washington and now lives in Austin, Tex., also cheers on Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cHer fianc\u00e9\u2019s not too crazy about it,\u201d Mr. Mulroy said. \u201cHe\u2019s a U.T. fan\u201d \u2014 the University of Texas \u2014 \u201cand she follows the Irish.

Christopher Layne, distinguished Professor of International Affairs and Robert M. Gates Chair in National Security at the Bush School of Government and Public Service, argues that global power is shifting from West to East, leading to an American decline in influence and loss of global dominance. Those who support this notion often table the following grounds or arguments.\n\nDue to its policies in the Middle East and Latin America, America lost its soft power influence over other countries. At home, the state of permanent impasse in Congress is making it extremely difficult to make any progress in making decisions or reforming outdated and often counterproductive laws. Some even compare the United States with the British Empire, referring to its collapse a century ago. But, at the very least, this viewpoint suggests that America has lost the favour of many countries. Meanwhile, China has reached the status of a great power and globalization has become omnipresent. Stephen Walt, Belfer Professor of International Affairs at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, argues that 'the real issue is whether developments at home and overseas are making it harder for the United States to exercise the kind of dominant influence that it did for much of the later half of the 20th century.' According to this view, the United States is not declining and is still one of the most powerful countries in the world, but its capacity to lead global order has been diminished due to the array of domestic and foreign policy failures. The post Cold War international affairs culture endorses this truth.\n\nIn his book 'The China Choice', Hugh White fleshes this out with three arguments. First, 'as India emerges as a great power in its own right\u2026its aim will be to maximise its own power, not support America's.' Second, 'the stronger India becomes, the less it will need America to help balance China.' And third, 'the stronger China is relative to India, the more cautious Delhi will be about sacrificing its interest in a good relationship with Beijing.' To examine this emerging American-Indian geopolitical landscape , three factors determine the scope of this relationship: Firstly because they saw that benefits might accrue from being seen as valuable partners; secondly because the success and consequent emboldening of a regional hegemon would threaten them in the future; and thirdly, perhaps also because they had some commitment to, and interest in, basic norms of international conduct, such as preservation of the territorial status quo. It is not hard to see how each of these three dynamics could characterize a future Asian conflict. China's heft works both ways: it dissuades middle powers from exposing themselves to a US-China fight. India has a wide range of interests at stake in its relationship with China and India cannot afford to subordinate those interests to the concerns of America or Japan, or Australia.'\n\nThe first part may be partly true, but the second is less clear. India might well bandwagon in some areas becoming gradually more interoperable with the US, and balance in others, continuing to work at odds with Washington on, say, trade or climate change. Up to a point, one can indeed disaggregate these different economic/diplomatic and security/military elements. While many security and foreign policy analysts criticized US President Donald Trump's Afghanistan policy for lacking a clear-cut strategy, Trump's Afghanistan policy and Washington's obsession towards India has the potential to alter the geopolitical balance in the volatile region, thereby making peace incompatible with regional dynamics. It is logical to think that Pakistan considered India the main enemy, and knowing that the US wanted India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, it was logical that Islamabad would get closer to Beijing. 'Pakistani authorities think that cooperating with China would be more useful for them in this scenario than working with the US. China, too, is supporting Pakistan on all regional and international forums,' the expert underlined.\n\nNo wonder then, that there are renewed calls within the US to restore a workable relationship with Pakistan. As the conservative US think tank, Hudson Institute put it in a recent report. A New Approach to Pakistan, 'the Trump Administration should both publicly and privately maintain avenues for Pakistan to become a US ally, as well as trade and investment partner, in the future'.The latest developments show the new US strategy, which seeks a bigger role for Pakistan's archrival India in the conflict, would drag South Asia towards more peace chaos. Significantly, India's smaller South Asian neighbours are fast moving towards developing closer relationships with China. Although this is generally perceived as an anti-India phenomenon, the reality is that Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are looking up to China as a new guarantor of help in the face of the US' heavy-handed approach towards them.\n\nAntoine Levesques, IISS Research Associate for South Asia, expected China to play a more 'pro-active' role in Afghanistan into 2018, foremost diplomatically. But this posture would be conditioned by security developments in the country; details within, or any evolutions of, the US strategy's framework; the outcome of Trump's planned visit to Beijing; and China's willingness to take greater risks, including on promoting Afghan reconciliation. The real irony about Trump's segregating South Asia policy lies in Washington's blunt denial of seeking peace priorities as compared to its twisted perusal of strategic interests with India, thereby making US's fragile role in South Asian affairs.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 19, 21, 12, 23, 6, 4, 13], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [13, 23, 14, 4, 5, 6, 21, 19, 12], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [12, 21, 5, 4, 14, 19, 13, 23, 6], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 14, 4, 19, 15, 21, 12, 5, 13], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 19, 21, 13, 6, 5, 12, 4, 14, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "On the seventh day of the Microsoft Store ' s 12 Days of Deals marathon , it ' s finally time to have some fun.\nToday , Microsoft ' s offering deep discounts on over 100 gaming laptops and desktop PCs.\nSome truly staggering deals are already out of stock.\nBut plenty of systems can still be found with discounts ranging from $ 100 to $ 600 or more depending on the PC and its configuration.\nThe Alienware 17 R4 , PCWorld ' s favorite 17 - inch gaming laptop , sells for $ 2 , 169 at other e - tailers in the US.", "text": "Credit: IDG/Gordon Mah Ung  \nOn the seventh day of the Microsoft Store\u2019s annual 12 Days of Deals marathon, it\u2019s finally time to have some fun .

After weighing the options, Schmidt made up her mind, and on Tuesday in the gym of Fillmore Central High School in Geneva she signed with Concordia University to throw for its track team.\n\n Basketball is close to Schmidt's heart, but so is throwing the shot. She couldn't turn down everything Concordia offered academically, too. And in track, there was more room to grow athletically.\n\n \"I can learn more things, like hammer and javelin. I feel like I have a lot more potential in track than in basketball,\" Schmidt said after the signing.\n\n There's a lot of moving parts on a team, and at times, it can be difficult for the group to work together to achieve a goal. But it's not the same with throwers in track. That's what Schmidt likes about it. It's all on her.\n\n \"If I'm not doing well, it's my fault. If I don't win, it's my fault,\" she said. \"I can always push myself to get better. It's harder as a team to push each other, but for me I can make myself better.\"\n\n Schmidt, whose personal best toss to date is 40 feet, 4 \u00be inches, also likes how technique-driven throwing is. Fillmore Central's throwing coach, Matt Tobias, has been a key asset in that area.\n\n \"I like to know exactly how I'm supposed to do it. I want my foot to turn this way, I want this motion ending there,\" Schmidt said. \"Coach Tobias is really good about knowing how I'm supposed to land and everything. I think the technical part is really important to me.\"\n\n Concordia's throwing coach, Ed McLaughlin, also attended the signing. Simply put: he loves the raw ability Schmidt possesses.\n\n \"She's got such a huge upside,\" McLaughlin said of Schmidt. \"She really hasn't thrown that much compared to a lot of other kids, and it makes a big difference with what you can see that she can do already, and what she hasn't done yet.\"\n\n McLaughlin has watched Schmidt throw for a couple of years now and saw the budding talent. But last year is when he really started to notice things pick up.\n\n \"I'm really excited to see how her senior season goes,\" McLaughlin said.\n\n Schmidt, who's also a starter on the Fillmore Central basketball team and averaged 12.6 points and 6.8 rebounds per contest, didn't want to go into the basketball season worrying about the looming college question. Now, she's free to have fun and just play ball without it weighing on her mind.\n\n \"I feel a lot better now that I've decided,\" she said.\n\n Winning the Class C-2 state basketball title is the obvious goal, but as for the track season, Schmidt has something else on mind. Who doesn't like a little family rivalry, right?\n\n \"I want to beat my sister's record,\" Schmidt said with a smile.\n\n That sister would be Alexis Schmidt, who currently throws for South Dakota State. Her Fillmore Central school record is 44-2.\n\n \"I have a long ways to go,\" Erin said with a laugh. \"If I beat her I might give her a call or just let her figure it out.

Hendrickson was just beginning his search for a new line of work and he did not yet know what would pique his interest. \n \nBut he for sure wasn\u2019t interested in farm work, except as a last resort. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of friends who have had summer jobs, like when they were in high school, picking fruit but I doubt anyone would make a career out of it,\u201d he said. \n \nAccording to local farm sector employers, most workers are paid well above Pennsylvania\u2019s minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Crew chiefs and foremen on some orchards earn close to $19 per hour. Yet few native-born Americans are willing to do this work, even if unemployed says Alan Dudley, administrator of the Gettysburg CareerLink office. \n \n\u201cThe work is difficult, especially in the fields, and it\u2019s not necessarily unskilled work,\" he said. \"Orchard owners want skilled people to harvest apples so they get the best return on their crop.\u201d \n \nAdams County\u2019s farms, orchards, and processing plants are where the jobs are. The so-called \u201cfruit belt\u201d of vast peach and apple orchards extends across the region\u2019s rolling green hills, along with the packing and processing companies and other agricultural-related businesses. \n \nTourism, with the 3 million visitors drawn annually to the historic Civil War battlefield of Gettysburg, is the other main economic generator. \n \nAdams County\u2019s $580-million fruit industry depends heavily on immigrant labor, which is why the country may be facing an unintended consequence of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigrants. \n \nBusinesses in the agricultural-based economy are experiencing labor shortages , and orchard owners are bracing for the possibility of not having enough workers for the fall harvest. \n \nFleeing workforce \n \nLast month, six Hispanic employees of a county fruit-packing company, which does not want to be identified, were picked up by local police and turned over to immigration agents, who sent them to a detention facility. These and other detentions have had a chilling effect on the county\u2019s Hispanic residents, who make up 6.5 percent of the population of some 100,000 people. \n \nYet because of the immigration crackdown, workers are not showing up or in some instances, have fled. The local plant of Hillandale Farms, a major national egg producer and distributor, was desperately seeking to fill vacant jobs this summer, according to a company official, because much of its Hispanic work force had disappeared. \n \nAs the autumn harvest approaches, the demand for labor is accelerating, Dudley says, not just in the orchards but also in the fruit processing and other agriculture-related industries. \n \n\u201cSo they\u2019re coming into their busy hiring season right now. For instance, Knouse Foods just last week posted about eight new positions on our job search website.\u201d \n \n\u2018No roving checkpoints\u2019 \n \nAdams County voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in last November\u2019s presidential election. \n \nAt the Latimore Valley fair in June, which attracted several thousand people to watch antique car races, trucking company secretary Kim Sanders expressed strong support for President Trump\u2019s policy of arresting and deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. \n \n\nBut, echoing the views of others at the fair who were asked the same question, Sanders wants the law-abiding undocumented immigrants to be able to stay. \n \n\u201cI hate to say it but there are not enough American people to go out and work on a farm, or do planting and pick vegetables like they will,\u201d she said. \n \nRepublican Congressman Scott Perry, whose district includes Adams County, has heard the concerns of orchard owners and other businesses in the fruit industry. Perry told VOA his message to them is that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has assured him nothing has changed in its enforcement actions. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s not like roving checkpoints,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re targeted enforcement.\u201d \n \nBut ICE has changed its policies somewhat. Acting-ICE chief Tom Homan told reporters at the White House last month that \u201c\u2026no populations are off the table. So non-criminals, those who have got a court order from a judge that refuse to leave, we\u2019re looking for.\u201d \n \nUnder the last two years of the previous Obama administration, non-criminals were not a priority and were often let go if detained. \n \nGrowers such as Kay Hollabaugh are running out of patience. She met last month with Congressman Perry and local lawmakers to express her concerns about the future of the Adams County fruit belt if the immigrant labor force is driven out. \n \n\u201cThose people who are making the laws of our land, eat every day,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could simply stop producing food for a month - OK, no food, no food - I think perhaps that would make some bells go off.\u201d \n\nRipening fruit \n \nThe Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy has galvanized activists in Adams County to press for immigration reform and to lobby local lawmakers to vote against measures that would target immigrant communities. \n \nJenny Dumont, a Spanish professor at Gettysburg College who leads the immigration lobbying effort for a grassroots group called \u201cGettysburg Rising, blames the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric for creating unwarranted fears about the undocumented. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty well documented that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans,\u201d Dumont said. \u201cMy sense is that people, if they\u2019ve had contact with immigrants here, that they understand the contributions that they make, they\u2019re able to see them as people not just the label immigrant, the other.\u201d \n \nBut Congressman Perry said the border would have to be secured before Americans would agree to any immigration reform measure. \n \n\u201cIf you just seal the border without doing some of these other reforms, we\u2019re going to have problems from a business standpoint as well, and I think they get that but again there\u2019s this mistrust,\" he said. \"They want to see action not words,\u201d the congressman said referring to border security. \n \nAs the push and pull over immigration policy plays out, farmers may get some relief as the federal government issues more visas for temporary agricultural workers, mainly from Mexico. The U.S. Labor Department has issued 20 percent more H-2A visas in 2017, compared to last year. Those visas are for seasonal agricultural work, such as harvesting berries, fruit or other crops. \n \nBut the visas require require farmers to demonstrate that no Americans will take the jobs they offer. In the meantime, the apple crop is ripening on the trees in Adams County. With harvesting about to begin in less than a month, orchard owners are not sure if enough workers will show up. \n \nKay Hollabaugh repeated what a top executive of a major food processor told her recently: \u201c\u2019If fruit goes, the Adams County economy falls and we\u2019re out of business.\u2019\u201d"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [23, 6, 12, 13, 5, 14, 21, 19, 4], "scores": [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [21, 4, 6, 13, 23, 12, 19, 5, 14], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [13, 12, 6, 14, 21, 5, 19, 23, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 12, 23, 19, 4, 5, 13, 21, 14], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [6, 15, 14, 12, 21, 5, 13, 19, 23, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "\"Modern Family\" star Sarah Hyland clarified the initial statement she made about her character Hayley Dunphy's sexuality.\nET on ABC When a fan asked Hyland if Hayley is indeed bisexual, the 26-year-old actress sent out what many believed was confirmation.\nThe ninth season of \"Modern Family\" premiered in September.", "text": "\"Modern Family\" star Sarah Hyland clarified the initial statement she made about her character Hayley Dunphy's sexuality.

He denies any vaginal intercourse took place but says the woman performed consensual oral sex on him. To convict the jury must be sure: \n Mr Jackson penetrated the complainant with his penis (It does not matter how slight or brief the penetration was),  The woman did not consent to this  And Mr Jackson knew she did not consent.  \nJudge Patricia Smyth said consent has a particular legal meaning: \u201cA woman consents if she agrees by choice and has the sense and capacity to agree by choice.\u201d \n \nConsent is different to submission.

He says she willingly performed oral sex on him.

The woman alleges he entered the room naked, thrust his penis at her and said: \u201cYou f**ked those guys. Why not me?\u201d Mr McIlroy says he entered the room fully clothed and the woman performed consensual oral sex on him. \n \nUnlike the first three charges, the woman\u2019s consent is not relevant to this accusation.

He is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police or omitting relevant facts which could have helped the investigation. Mr Harrison is accused of not disclosing relevant facts to officers when they took a witness statement from him on June 30th, 2016, two days after the alleged rape. These facts include: \n A text he received from the complainant in the hours after the alleged rape stating \u201cwhat happened was not consensual\u201d,  That he allegedly saw nudity on the night in question as demonstrated by a text he sent stating \u201cwent upstairs and there were more flutes than the Twelfth of July\u201d,  That he believed \u201cthings weren\u2019t going to end well\u201d after the alleged rape as demonstrated by a text he sent Mr McIlroy to that effect,  And that the complainant was significantly more distressed when he dropped her home in a taxi than he let on to police.  \nThe defence say he provided a truthful account and answered all questions put to him to the best of his ability. They deny he engaged in a cover-up to protect his friends. \n \nTo convict on this count the jury must be sure: \n Between June 27th and July 1st, 2016 Mr Harrison made a witness statement to police lying about his dealings with the woman or deliberating omitting relevant information,  It was possible that lie or omission could have perverted the course of justice  And that Mr Harrison intended to pervert the course of justice.  \nCount 6 \n \nMr Harrison is also accused of withholding information from police.

That makes Bezos worth roughly $49 billion more than Bill Gates and about $60 billion more than Warren Buffett. \n \nEarlier this year, Bezos officially became the richest person in the world and also helped make Amazon the second most valuable company in the world, behind Apple. His success can arguably be traced back to a risk he took when he was 30 years old, when Bezos was a high school student and the class valedictorian, and he got accepted via early admission to Princeton, according to Brad Stone\u2019s biography \u201cThe Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.\u201d He majored in computer science and electrical engineering, and then went on to work various finance and tech jobs after college. \n \nIt was while serving as a vice president at the hedge fund D. E. Shaw in the 1990s that Bezos came up with the idea to sell books over the Internet. Doing so, though, would mean taking a significant risk and perhaps sacrificing his stable job. Experts believe the\u00a0Amazon CEO is here to play to long game, and it is here for everyone to see as Bezos is remaking the world with its business acumen and operational prowess. \n \nThere are a number of things Amazon has taken in its strides, where his rivals falter.\u00a0The\u00a0 2017 Walker Sands Future of Retail \u00a0study found 84% of US consumers have made a purchase on Amazon in the past year, and 55% are Prime subscribers.

Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, the world\u2019s biggest software maker, owns about 1 per cent of the Redmond, Washington-based company.\u00a0Gates, the man who made Microsoft is more of an executor than a visionary. Rather than merely innovating or dreaming, Gates took a disciplined approach toward software as a potential source of business opportunities. \n \n\u201cAs we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others, said Gates. \n \nAs a leader his leadership style has a mixture of autocratic, visionary and participative approaches. He is actively involved in technology development for new products and in making various strategic decisions. He spends most of his time for staying touch with customers and employees around the world. He expects his managers to have their own personal influence and to take decisions assuming they are the CEO of the organization which showed the participative leadership style. \u00a0 \n \nBill Gates sees and thinks differently than most people do.\u00a0 David Aston, who worked with Gates mentions in his blog that gates has an amazing ability to find the flaws, or see opportunities, or connect the dots.\u00a0 He can zoom in to details with precision or zoom out to the big picture.\u00a0 He can flip back in time or fast forward to the future.\u00a0 He also has the ability to focus on the merits of the idea or innovation before worrying about the business case.\u00a0 Chances are, you could benefit from Bill\u2019s thinking skills, even if it simply means getting a new perspective on your problems.\u00a0 \n \nLike a true entrepreneur, Gates saw the \u201cstructural holes\u201d in the personal computing marketplace and moved in to occupy them, always in a subordinate spot to the big players. His method was: \u2018Act strategically, partner powerfully\u2019, which made him different from most others. \n \nFacebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg with USD 81.6 billion net worth has become the third richest person on the globe. He has overtaken Warren Buffett to sit at the third position in the global ranking of richest persons. Buffett is the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway. He has given away massive wealth to charity. Once the wealthiest person, Buffett is sliding in rank thanks to his charity work. Since 2006, Buffett has donated 290 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to charity, most of them to Gates\u2019 foundation. Those shares are worth more than $50bn now. \n \nAs per Bloomberg estimates, Zuckerberg now trail only Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates.

A TEA is defined as a rural area or an area where the unemployment rate is at least 150% of the national average. The EB-5 program has delegated to states the authority to designate various TEAs on a project-specific basis. By locating a commercial enterprise in a state-designated TEA, foreign investors sharply reduce the size of investment that is needed to qualify for a green card. \n\nThe EB-5 regulations, which were written in 1990, take a geocentric approach to defining TEAs by assuming that an enterprise's employees live near its principle place of business. In 1990, this was not an unreasonable assumption. It is today. It is now common for American workers to physically commute to jobs that are located in different metropolitan areas and to cyber-commute to jobs anywhere in the country. Internet-based employment is an efficient means of providing economic opportunities to workers who live in rural America and areas of high unemployment. \n\nThe current TEA designation process has been the subject of criticism over concerns that the EB-5 investments are not helping the program's intended beneficiaries. In response to criticism and the passage of time, DHS is updating its EB-5 regulations. DHS's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking explains that the program's reliance \"on states' TEA designations has resulted in the application of inconsistent rules by different states. ... the deference to state determinations provided by current regulations has resulted in the acceptance of some TEAs that consist of areas of relative economic prosperity linked to areas with lower employment, and some TEAs that have been criticized as 'gerrymandered.'\" \n\nDHS's response to this concern is a proposal to (1) centralize TEA decisions in Washington and (2) create an even more georestrictive requirement for TEAs. The proposed rule does not consider Americans who could \"commute\" to work via the internet. In short, the proposed regulation doubles-down on the 1990 mindset that workers live near their place of employment, a faulty assumption that has helped fuel the \"gerrymandering\" issue. \n\nThere is no statutory requirement that new commercial enterprises be physically located in TEAs in order for investors to qualify for the TEA provisions of the EB-5 program. To the contrary, the statute states that investor visas \"shall be reserved for qualified immigrants who invest in a new commercial enterprise ... which will create employment in a targeted employment area.\" \n\nOne option for the EB-5 program would be to allow a new commercial enterprise to qualify for TEA EB-5 investment, irrespective of the business's location, by committing to hire workers who live in a designated TEA. By leveraging the internet, the EB-5 program could provide technology jobs to Americans who live in rural and high unemployment areas. \n\nBy Bruce Levinson, SVP, Regulatory Intervention - Center for Regulatory Effectiveness \n\nRelated topics: Law, Policy & Regulation\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [23, 6, 19, 21, 14, 13, 5, 12, 4], "scores": [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [5, 6, 12, 14, 4, 19, 21, 23, 13], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [23, 21, 13, 6, 15, 19, 14, 4, 5, 15, 12], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 6, 12, 5, 23, 14, 21, 4], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 23, 19, 13, 6, 21, 12, 5, 14, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Today, Microsoft's offering deep discounts on over 100 gaming laptops and desktop PCs.\nDell Inspiron 15 7577 i7577 -5258BLK-PUS for $899.\nThe GTX 1050 GPU won't melt your face but it's still PCWorld's pick for the best budget graphics card.\nAsus ROG Zephyrus GX501VI-US74 for $2,499.\nUses Nvidia's Max-Q technology to cram GTX 1080 into notebook.\nRazer DeathAdder Elite is one of the most popular gaming mice in the world.\nDell makes damned fine monitors.\nThere are 118 gaming PC and PC peripheral deals in total.\nOn Microsoft's seventh day of deals.\nSo head on over and take a peek.", "text": "Credit: IDG/Gordon Mah Ung  \nOn the seventh day of the Microsoft Store\u2019s annual 12 Days of Deals marathon, it\u2019s finally time to have some fun . Today, Microsoft\u2019s offering deep discounts on over 100 gaming laptops and desktop PCs. \n \nSome truly staggering deals are already out of stock as I write this around 8:30 A.M. Eastern, and it\u2019s easy to see why\u2014they paired potent gaming PCs with Windows Mixed Reality headsets for $500 to $650 off. But plenty of systems can still be found with discounts ranging from $100 to $600 or more depending on the PC and its configuration. As PCWorld\u2019s resident gaming and graphics guru, here are some particularly juicy deals that caught my eye: \n Dell Inspiron 15 7577 i7577-5258BLK-PUS for $899 ($200 discount): You don\u2019t find laptops with a GeForce GTX 1060 graphics chip selling for under $1,000 very often.  Dell Inspiron 15 i5577-5858BLK-PUS for $600 ($200 discount): The GTX 1050 GPU in this more modest sibling of the above deal won\u2019t melt your face, but it\u2019s still PCWorld\u2019s pick for the best budget graphics card . And a gaming laptop for just $600? Snag it while you can.  Alienware 17 R4 AW17R4-7004SLV-PUS for $1,899 ($600 discount): Okay, this discount isn\u2019t as steep as Microsoft claims, as you can find this notebook selling for $2,169 at other e-tailers. But it\u2019s still a solid deal on the Alienware 17 R4 , PCWorld\u2019s favorite 17-inch gaming laptop .  Asus ROG Zephyrus GX501VI-US74 for $2,499 ($200 discount): And here\u2019s our favorite 15.6-inch gaming laptop going for a solid $200 off mere months after launch. The stunning ROG Zephyrus uses Nvidia\u2019s Max-Q technology to cram the GTX 1080\u2019s power into an incredibly thin and light notebook, bolstered by a luscious 120Hz G-Sync display. The battery life stinks though.   IDG / Adam Patrick Murray  MSI Trident 3 VR7RC-028US Signature Edition for $849 ($150 discount): Core i5, a GTX 1060, and a 1TB hard drive paired with a 128GB SSD is a solid deal for this price\u2014doubly so when it comes in a console-sized case that\u2019s surprisingly quiet. We just reviewed a more potent version of the Trident 3 and fell in love with it.  Alienware 15 R3 AW15R3-7003SLV-PUS for $1,599 ($600 discount): Now\u2019s the time to buy an Alienware laptop, it seems. The Alienware 15 R3 just earned a 4 out of 5 star rating in a PCWorld review, and that was at its full $2,199 price. This beast delivers desktop-class firepower in a case you can tuck into your backpack.  Razer DeathAdder Elite for $50 ($20 discount): The DeathAdder Elite is one of the most popular gaming mice in the world, and for good reason: You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a better mouse for first-person shooters. But the DeathAdder\u2019s shape feels divine in your hand even for office tasks. It\u2019s my personal go-to mouse, and the Elite version never sells for anything cheaper than this. Lots of other Razer keyboards and mice are on sale, too.  Dell 28 Ultra HD 4K Monitor - S2817Q for $399 ($230 discount): Dell makes damned fine monitors. Damned fine 4K monitors are almost impossible to find for less than $500. Snatch this up if you\u2019ve been looking to upgrade your display to ultra HD. Gamers take note: This monitor does not feature G-Sync or FreeSync technology .  Lenovo Y gaming mouse mat for $5 ($5 discount): I haven\u2019t touched this, but it\u2019s a microfiber gaming mouse mat for just $5. Why not chuck it in the cart and give it a try if you\u2019re buying something else too?  \nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. There are 118 gaming PC and PC peripheral deals in total on Microsoft\u2019s seventh day of deals, so head on over and take a peek even if none of the ones above strike your fancy. Be warned: Several of the desktop deals feature older 6th-gen Intel Core processors. They\u2019ll still do just fine for gaming\u2014especially in a configuration like this beastly HP Omen desktop \u2014but note that we\u2019re up to 8th generation Core chips now. And if you\u2019re considering a gaming laptop that we didn\u2019t mention above, be sure to consult PCWorld\u2019s laptop buyer\u2019s guide and mobile gaming GPU guide to make sure you\u2019re making a wise choose.

Hendrickson was just beginning his search for a new line of work and he did not yet know what would pique his interest. \n \nBut he for sure wasn\u2019t interested in farm work, except as a last resort. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of friends who have had summer jobs, like when they were in high school, picking fruit but I doubt anyone would make a career out of it,\u201d he said. \n \nAccording to local farm sector employers, most workers are paid well above Pennsylvania\u2019s minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Crew chiefs and foremen on some orchards earn close to $19 per hour. Yet few native-born Americans are willing to do this work, even if unemployed says Alan Dudley, administrator of the Gettysburg CareerLink office. \n \n\u201cThe work is difficult, especially in the fields, and it\u2019s not necessarily unskilled work,\" he said. \"Orchard owners want skilled people to harvest apples so they get the best return on their crop.\u201d \n \nAdams County\u2019s farms, orchards, and processing plants are where the jobs are. The so-called \u201cfruit belt\u201d of vast peach and apple orchards extends across the region\u2019s rolling green hills, along with the packing and processing companies and other agricultural-related businesses. \n \nTourism, with the 3 million visitors drawn annually to the historic Civil War battlefield of Gettysburg, is the other main economic generator. \n \nAdams County\u2019s $580-million fruit industry depends heavily on immigrant labor, which is why the country may be facing an unintended consequence of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigrants. \n \nBusinesses in the agricultural-based economy are experiencing labor shortages , and orchard owners are bracing for the possibility of not having enough workers for the fall harvest. \n \nFleeing workforce \n \nLast month, six Hispanic employees of a county fruit-packing company, which does not want to be identified, were picked up by local police and turned over to immigration agents, who sent them to a detention facility. These and other detentions have had a chilling effect on the county\u2019s Hispanic residents, who make up 6.5 percent of the population of some 100,000 people. \n \nYet because of the immigration crackdown, workers are not showing up or in some instances, have fled. The local plant of Hillandale Farms, a major national egg producer and distributor, was desperately seeking to fill vacant jobs this summer, according to a company official, because much of its Hispanic work force had disappeared. \n \nAs the autumn harvest approaches, the demand for labor is accelerating, Dudley says, not just in the orchards but also in the fruit processing and other agriculture-related industries. \n \n\u201cSo they\u2019re coming into their busy hiring season right now. For instance, Knouse Foods just last week posted about eight new positions on our job search website.\u201d \n \n\u2018No roving checkpoints\u2019 \n \nAdams County voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in last November\u2019s presidential election. \n \nAt the Latimore Valley fair in June, which attracted several thousand people to watch antique car races, trucking company secretary Kim Sanders expressed strong support for President Trump\u2019s policy of arresting and deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. \n \n\nBut, echoing the views of others at the fair who were asked the same question, Sanders wants the law-abiding undocumented immigrants to be able to stay. \n \n\u201cI hate to say it but there are not enough American people to go out and work on a farm, or do planting and pick vegetables like they will,\u201d she said. \n \nRepublican Congressman Scott Perry, whose district includes Adams County, has heard the concerns of orchard owners and other businesses in the fruit industry. Perry told VOA his message to them is that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has assured him nothing has changed in its enforcement actions. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s not like roving checkpoints,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re targeted enforcement.\u201d \n \nBut ICE has changed its policies somewhat. Acting-ICE chief Tom Homan told reporters at the White House last month that \u201c\u2026no populations are off the table. So non-criminals, those who have got a court order from a judge that refuse to leave, we\u2019re looking for.\u201d \n \nUnder the last two years of the previous Obama administration, non-criminals were not a priority and were often let go if detained. \n \nGrowers such as Kay Hollabaugh are running out of patience. She met last month with Congressman Perry and local lawmakers to express her concerns about the future of the Adams County fruit belt if the immigrant labor force is driven out. \n \n\u201cThose people who are making the laws of our land, eat every day,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could simply stop producing food for a month - OK, no food, no food - I think perhaps that would make some bells go off.\u201d \n\nRipening fruit \n \nThe Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy has galvanized activists in Adams County to press for immigration reform and to lobby local lawmakers to vote against measures that would target immigrant communities. \n \nJenny Dumont, a Spanish professor at Gettysburg College who leads the immigration lobbying effort for a grassroots group called \u201cGettysburg Rising, blames the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric for creating unwarranted fears about the undocumented. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty well documented that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans,\u201d Dumont said. \u201cMy sense is that people, if they\u2019ve had contact with immigrants here, that they understand the contributions that they make, they\u2019re able to see them as people not just the label immigrant, the other.\u201d \n \nBut Congressman Perry said the border would have to be secured before Americans would agree to any immigration reform measure. \n \n\u201cIf you just seal the border without doing some of these other reforms, we\u2019re going to have problems from a business standpoint as well, and I think they get that but again there\u2019s this mistrust,\" he said. \"They want to see action not words,\u201d the congressman said referring to border security. \n \nAs the push and pull over immigration policy plays out, farmers may get some relief as the federal government issues more visas for temporary agricultural workers, mainly from Mexico. The U.S. Labor Department has issued 20 percent more H-2A visas in 2017, compared to last year.

It's about a woman who tries to exorcise the ghost of her deceased mother through writing. As memories of her mother, a biracial woman from Haiti who passed for white in the largely Jim Crow South, force themselves into the daughter's mind, she chronicles, fearlessly, the pain and confusion that both of them suffered as they tried to find their way in a segregated, class-bound world.\n\nEach section concentrates on an aspect of the author's experience, but none tells a straight story. Photographs, snippets of songs, moments of longing and regret, scenes of confusion, loss and horror become part of a mesmeric whole. The narrative starts and stops, doesn't play by the usual temporal rules. Dayan's story refuses to obey the logic of linear time, questions the finality of death, upends rationalist notions of cause and effect, and reproduces over and over the chaotic, un-rule-governed quality of actual human experience.\n\n\"In the Belly of Her Ghost\" does not make unsettling assertions about the nature of reality in an explicit way; they are not the point of the story but its unavoidable substance. When your mother dies and comes back as a spider and makes droplets of blood appear on the walls, when her spidery presence is stamped on the veins of your own eye -- anything to get attention -- the supernatural is not a matter of belief but of life as you lived it.\n\nWe sense the author reasoning to herself: Maybe if she can call her mother up on the page, dress her in ball gowns and jewels, capture the stunning beauty of her face and form, call her to account for her life of pretense -- pretending to be white, to be upper middle class, to belong at the country club -- but also sympathize with her for the agony this caused her, maybe if we can be made to see how unhappy she was with the husband who commanded this performance, and see how unable to support and care for her child she was since she herself hardly existed, maybe then, the author hopes, the mother will finally be able to let go.\n\nOr maybe it's the other way around.\n\nIn her repeated visits to Haiti, where her mother was born, in carrying her mother's paintings, silver, china, crystal with her when she moves to take a prestigious job, in poring over the photographs of her mother that her father took compulsively, in remembering the lust in her mother's voice on the phone with a lover, her absence at school functions, perhaps Dayan is trying to possess the mother she never really had.\n\nShe had a real mother, though, just not the one who bore her. Lucille, the African American maid who cared for Colin, was everything her mother was not: racially unambiguous, real and there. If Dayan's mother haunts the book -- destructive, passionate and despairing -- Lucille cuts through the posturing with reminders of mortality. Lucille, writes Dayan, \"gave me the chance not to live a lie.\" Lucille patched her clothes, sang to her, approved of the world of snakes, frogs and spiders that Colin loved. Lucille understood things that were alive, things that could kill, things that died. \"Bugs and dirt\" is what it all comes down to in the end, said Lucille, \"bugs and dirt.\"\n\nThe memoir insists on the uncanny power of physical objects, makes them come alive. The crazed quality of her mother's things constantly erupts into the narrative: \"diamonds stashed deep into a jar of cold cream ... wicker baskets, with mangoes rotting, crosses hidden in jiffy bags, lizards bleeding in the dirt, and the heads of cocks wrapped in mosquito netting.\" The combination of ornament, violence and rot spills over into Colin's own possessions: her mutilated dolls still lie in the basement, their \"lace dresses ... intact, their hair ... cut or shaved off; and their eyes, which I had not hurt ... rotted, as if they had been eaten away by acid.\" \"Things, like ghosts,\" says Dayan, \"know what they want.\" They keep coming back in her mind, all jumbled together.\n\nPursued by ghosts, unable to appease or escape them, Dayan casts a spell over the reader, who, immersed in her mind-expanding world of spirits, blood, and dirt, songs and snakes, her mother and the South, wishes the story didn't have to end. And in a way it doesn't have to. Because of the vividness of its scenes and the power of its language, and because it thrusts us into realms not usually visited in memoir, it will go on my shelf for a while, and then, I know, it will come back to life, a revenant, just as alive the second or third time around as it was before.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [13, 23, 6, 4, 14, 19, 21, 12, 5], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 6, 23, 4, 5, 21, 12, 14], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [23, 13, 21, 6, 14, 5, 19, 4, 12], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [19, 12, 21, 6, 5, 14, 4, 13, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 21, 12, 23, 13, 6, 5, 14, 19, 15, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Storytelling sessions were part of successful LiveLighter South West Multicultural Festival.\nFive community individuals shared their journeys to Bunbury at public cafe sessions.", "text": "| South Western Times \nSaturday, 3 March 2018 6:44AM Bob Slettering spoke at Cafez as part of the Multicultural festival storytelling sessions.

The situation is even worse in rural areas which teachers shun citing lack of basic infrastructure like proper housing, electricity and potable water.\n\nThe sad state of affairs was threatening to undo gains registered in the education sector since independence in 1980. The gains were achievable courtesy of a deliberate policy by President Mugabe to ensure education is the backbone of socio-political-economic development.\n\nThis was achieved through massive teacher training programmes soon after independence that facilitated the decolonisation of a sector long monopolised by a white minority.\n\nThe free education for all policy ensured every Zimbabwean had access to education and this explains why today Zimbabwe stands tall in Africa in so far as literacy is concerned.\n\nThis was courtesy of the visionary leadership of President Mugabe whose stance on education is known by all.

We urge authorities to consider schools in remote areas when deploying the new teachers to afford all pupils equal access to education.\n\nIn this environment where employment is hard to come-by, we urge teachers not to be selective.

The UX will compete with a variety of other models, including but not limited to the BMW X1 and X2, Audi Q2 and Q3, Volvo XC40 and Jaguar E-Pace. \n\nBut where the European cars all come with a variety of powertrains, over a dozen in some cases, the UX has only two. There's the base UX 200, which we see in Paris, and it's got a 2.0-liter inline-four sending 171 HP and 205 Nm (151 lb-ft) to the front wheels via a CVT . \n\nThat might work in Russia and neighboring countries, but we believe the real go-getter is the UX 250h, which is an AWD hybrid with the electric motor over the rear axle and total output of 178 HP but slightly less torque, so it might not have the pulling power of its diesel rivals. \n\nThis will be the only version that's available in Britain. Look for 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) in 8.5 seconds and decent fuel economy around town. Though due to new emissions tests, its 102 grams of CO2 emitted makes the UX hybrid seem dirtier than it really is. \n\nThe UX is more like a car than a crossover. You sit noticeably lower in it compared to the Volvo XV40, and the dashboard rises to meet you. Speaking of the dash, it's got as many buttons as Dr. Dre's mix table.

This young actor is a genuine marvel, as hilarious as she is heart-breaking. And as Alma in Williams\u2019 rarely-performed 1948 play, she\u2019s hit a real high note.\n\nIn fact, Rebecca Frecknall\u2019s whole production seems to tremble like a sustained, held high note: fragile, uncertain, almost unbearably tense.\n\nMusic is key in her pleasingly abstract revival: nine pianos make a semi-circle, fronts off so you can see their anatomy (something that'll become thematically important). The cast play Angus MacRae\u2019s score like a subtext, amplifying unspoken desires and fears.\n\nAlma is a young southern woman, a dutiful minister\u2019s daughter who\u2019s so nervous she\u2019s prone to panic attacks. She\u2019s in love her with her neighbour, John, a trainee doctor. He mocks her affected, convoluted speech \u2013 which Ferran mines brilliantly for laughs, while making clear it\u2019s a protective suit for a sensitive soul.\n\nHe obviously sees something in her too, but is busy going concertedly off the rails: drinking every night at the casino, scandalously fooling around with its owner\u2019s beautiful daughter (an appropriately luscious Anjana Vasan, who at one point gives a smoking-hot, soulful rendition of Portishead\u2019s \"Glory Box\").\n\nJohn is marvellously played by Matthew Needham, amused deadpan mocks giving way to a stare so intense you worry it might set Ferran\u2019s hair on fire. John is a dick, frankly, in the way he treats women. But god, you never doubt these two are meant for each other, that they have a unique ability to kindle a fire in each other.\n\nThe moment when he unbuttons her blouse \u2013 yes, yes, she is literally buttoned up, Williams ain\u2019t always subtle \u2013 to put a stethoscope to her chest carries an insane erotic charge. Her heart\u2019s not the only one racing.\n\nOpposite attract, right? Williams\u2019 play beautifully pushes this idea to its extremes, excavating two personalities and questioning societal assumptions about what men and women really want.\n\nWe start with a dichotomy: Alma is the soul, John the body. She is order, he anarchy. He forces her to look at an anatomy chart; she knows it\u2019s missing something. Why shouldn\u2019t he just give himself up to physical pleasures, he growls? Because they could connect on a much more profound level, she insists.\n\nThey both feel it in both body and soul, really. But it\u2019s about what makes you vulnerable: he can\u2019t bear to crack open his heart, she\u2019s too scared to lift the lid on her physical desire. One of the joys of Ferran\u2019s performance is the way her incredibly exact gestures of anxiety \u2013 her hand fluttering to her neck, the mystery of what do with one\u2019s elbows \u2013 also so perfectly reveal vast stores of repressed bodily longing. She\u2019s like a glass, brimming with water; you hold your breath for the moment it\u2019ll spill. The moment, of course, comes too late.\n\nSimply staged, with only a few chairs, and gorgeously lit by Lee Curran (I loved how fireworks flashed in the bellies of the pianos), there is barely a bum note here. Frecknall\u2019s production has a ballsy confidence in its non-naturalistic approach, rescuing Williams\u2019 play from polite fussiness, but there\u2019s also delicacy and precision. An evening that makes a case for this play, announces Frecknall as a director of real vision, and confirms Ferran as one of our finest actresses.

After weighing the options, Schmidt made up her mind, and on Tuesday in the gym of Fillmore Central High School in Geneva she signed with Concordia University to throw for its track team.\n\n Basketball is close to Schmidt's heart, but so is throwing the shot. She couldn't turn down everything Concordia offered academically, too. And in track, there was more room to grow athletically.\n\n \"I can learn more things, like hammer and javelin. I feel like I have a lot more potential in track than in basketball,\" Schmidt said after the signing.\n\n There's a lot of moving parts on a team, and at times, it can be difficult for the group to work together to achieve a goal.

It's harder as a team to push each other, but for me I can make myself better.\"\n\n Schmidt, whose personal best toss to date is 40 feet, 4 \u00be inches, also likes how technique-driven throwing is. Fillmore Central's throwing coach, Matt Tobias, has been a key asset in that area.\n\n \"I like to know exactly how I'm supposed to do it.

Now, she's free to have fun and just play ball without it weighing on her mind.\n\n \"I feel a lot better now that I've decided,\" she said.\n\n Winning the Class C-2 state basketball title is the obvious goal, but as for the track season, Schmidt has something else on mind. Who doesn't like a little family rivalry, right?\n\n \"I want to beat my sister's record,\" Schmidt said with a smile.\n\n That sister would be Alexis Schmidt, who currently throws for South Dakota State.

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" \n \nThis was passed in the wake of the Civil War, to ensure that slaves born in the United States were granted full citizenship, no matter the state laws. \n \nThat's also one reason the 14th Amendment has been a perennial obsession of white nationalists and right-wing militia groups, such as the sovereign citizen movement. \n \nBut rarely if ever has this wingnut argument made its way to the Oval Office. \n \nPlay to the base prejudice aside, the President cannot undo the Constitution. That's basic separation of powers stuff. \n \nThe President told Axios -- which seemed tipped off to ask the question by the White House in advance of the launch of its HBO special series -- that unnamed advisers had told him he could overturn birthright citizenship through the legislature or by executive order. \n \nThis is BS. No adviser with a passing understanding of the US government would seriously suggest this. Far more likely is that Trump was floating a trial balloon to change the national conversation and inflame the base. \n \nBut this trial balloon is particularly ironic given the conservative movement's obsession with Obama-era executive orders, which it loudly argued marked an assault on the Constitution, calling him \"King Obama\" -- and much worse. In contrast, they claimed to be \"constitutional conservatives\" -- faithful to the vision of the Founding Fathers. \n \nThere's nothing particularly wrong with executive orders -- George Washington and Thomas Jefferson used them and they ballooned under Republicans Ulysses S. Grant and Teddy Roosevelt. In fact, Barack Obama used fewer executive orders than his predecessors George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan -- though you'd never know it from watching Fox News during the last presidency. And then there's this: Trump is on pace to exceed the number of Obama executive orders if he serves two terms. (Obama issued an average of 35 executive orders a year. If Trump were to issue no more executive orders this year, his average would be 43 per year.) \n \nBut having raised the issue as a threat to the Constitution, it is absurd that Republicans are now ignoring or even encouraging the action because a president of their party is in power. Even more absurd is the fact that Trump has been issuing executive orders while Republicans have unified control of government. Such orders are most rationally used to overcome an obstructive opposition in Congress. \n \nAnother fundamental Trump mis-truth is the idea that birthright citizenship is unique to the United States. It's not. Canada and Mexico, and more than two dozen other countries, have similar statutes. \n \nVice President Mike Pence tried to support Trump when he said Tuesday, \"We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether or not the language of the 14th Amendment, 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally.\" \n \nBut Republican Rep. Justin Amash was right when he tweeted , \"A president cannot amend Constitution or laws via executive order. Concept of natural-born citizen in #14thAmendment derives from natural-born subject in Britain. Phrase 'and subject to the jurisdiction thereof' excludes mainly foreign diplomats, who are not subject to U.S. laws.\" \n \nSen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, made the point bipartisan: \"This notion that he can simply violate the Constitution by executive order, let's face it, no serious legal scholar thinks that's real.\" \n \nAs we've seen, some Trump defenders will point to \"anchor baby tourism\" as a problem in need of a solution. There are indeed properties that cater to this abuse of birthright citizenship. Trump should know -- his own Trump-branded properties in Florida are often advertised by third parties to expectant Russian parents, as The Daily Beast reported back in 2017 when I was editor-in-chief. Physician, heal thyself. And the President can start by cracking down on the practice through law enforcement rather than threatening to ignore the Constitution. \n \nBut just because the President can't unilaterally override the Constitution doesn't mean he won't try. He could sign an executive order, possibly against the legal advice of his Justice Department and immediately have the proposal blocked by suits from several states attorneys general. Because this isn't a jump ball, the issue will fail on the merits when it reaches the courts. \n \nBy then the President may have milked this for political benefit. So make no mistake -- this is play-to-the-base panic, a classic Trump attempt to distract and deflect.

This virus causes severe diarrhea, nausea, and stomach pain. \n \nAlthough often referred to as the \u201ccruise ship\u201d virus in the United States, noroviruses are an expensive and serious public health problem particularly among young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised patients. Now, in a new study published in Immunity this week, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have used a mouse model to show that, even in immunized animals, noroviruses can escape the immune system and still spread by hiding out in an extremely rare type of cell in the gut. \n \n\u201cCurrent vaccines against norovirus have been ineffective despite eliciting strong antibody responses,\u201d said senior author E. John Wherry, PhD, a professor of Microbiology and director of the Penn Institute for Immunology. \u201cUnderstanding the unique norovirus characteristic of hiding from the host immune system may explain its biology and present opportunities to improve vaccines and therapeutics.\u201d \n \nWhile most infected people clear the virus within a few days, some individuals continue to shed virus for weeks to months after. Such persistently infected people may be a source of outbreaks, but it was unclear why the immune system fails to eliminate the virus in these cases. \n \n\u201cThe cruise ship outbreaks of norovirus are high profile, but it happens everywhere \u2013 daycare centers, eldercare facilities, and more,\u201d said first author Vesselin T. Tomov, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Gastroenterology. \u201cNoroviruses can cause persistent infections, challenging the long-held view that they are transient pathogens.\u201d \n \nThe Penn investigators defined and tracked T-cell responses in mice infected with either an acute or chronic strain of mouse norovirus to gain insight into mechanisms of viral clearance and persistence. At first, they hypothesized that persistent norovirus infection caused T cells to become exhausted rendering them non-functioning, similar to other chronic viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C. To their surprise, however, T cells remained functional even after months of norovirus infection. \n \nThe team then looked at the earliest stages of response by the immune system and found two phases to that response. During the initial days after infection, T cells reacted strongly to the virus and controlled it. But, after about three days, T cells could no longer detect norovirus in 50 to 70 percent of the mice infected with the chronic strain. \n \nThe researchers faced a paradox because the T cells responding to the virus appeared \u201cignorant\u201d or \u201cunable to see\u201d the virus, yet there was continuous shedding of norovirus in mouse feces. To explain this conundrum, they next hypothesized that actively multiplying norovirus had been sequestered somewhere in the gut out of reach of T cells. \n \nTomov conducted a series of experiments to test that hypothesis. He eventually found evidence that norovirus does hide in rare gut cells that fail to communicate with T cells and alert them of the presence of the pathogen. \u201cWe found a novel escape mechanism where norovirus becomes essentially invisible to the immune system in the intestine while still producing large amounts of virus that is shed from the intestines,\u201d Tomov said. \n \nCoauthors at Washington University have found that norovirus hides in specialized, ultra-rare cells of the gut lining, on the order of only a few hundred cells out of the billions that line the mouse gut. These cells act as mega factories for norovirus production, while allowing the virus to evade the immune system. The team is now working on this aspect of norovirus infection. \n \nThese findings might help explain why norovirus vaccines being tested have shown limited effectiveness and also hint that future vaccines would need to elicit immunity that acts very robustly in the first three days after infection before the virus moves into hiding. The results also dovetail with the fact that no one has yet found an animal reservoir for the virus. \u201cThere may be some people out there who are living with the chronic strain of the virus and are persistently, yet unknowingly, shedding it,\u201d Tomov said. \n \nNext, the researchers plan to investigate how to improve protection against this virus by combining T cell and antibody approaches for vaccines. Identifying the cellular reservoir of norovirus may also enable the development of therapeutics to help prevent or purge persisting infection. In addition, testing whether similar mechanisms occur in humans is a major goal that will not only enable better vaccine development, but also help test for a potential role of norovirus as a co-factor in other intestinal diseases. \n Chinese \u00a0French \u00a0German \u00a0Italian \u00a0Japanese \u00a0Korean \u00a0Portuguese \u00a0Russian \u00a0Spanish"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 21, 6, 12, 13, 23, 4, 19], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 21, 4, 19, 6, 13, 12, 23], "scores": [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 21, 13, 5, 14, 4, 19, 12, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [6, 19, 4, 5, 14, 21, 13, 12, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 19, 6, 21, 13, 5, 14, 12, 4, 23], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Patricia de Lille and JP Smith have been placed on special leave from party activities.\nThe spat is a sign of factionalism and infighting in the DA , the ANC in the Western Cape says.\nDe Lille lashed out at Smith on Monday via a press release.\nShe accused him of dragging her name through the mud with claims he made about the closure of a City anti - crime unit.", "text": "The spat between Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services, JP Smith, is a sign of factionalism and infighting in the DA, the ANC in the Western Cape said on Tuesday.\n\n\"During the 2016 elections we told you that there is a cold war within the DA and you did not believe us,\" the party's chairperson in the Dullah Omar region Xolani Sotashe said at a briefing in Philippi East.\n\n\"Now we feel vindicated.\"\n\nSotashe accused De Lille of changing allegiances \"like a chameleon\", after moving from the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to the Independent Democrats (ID), and then agreeing to be absorbed into the Democratic Alliance (DA).\n\nSotashe claimed that the DA only wanted De Lille for what he called \"the coloured vote\".\n\n\"The marriage between De Lille and Helen Zille was not going to last,\" he continued.\n\nHe said Smith did nothing without checking first with Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, adding that he was \"ineffective\".\n\nThe ANC said it would also give the Public Protector's office proof of an alleged R9.2m spent on roofing in Bellville which was never done, even though the City had already paid for the work.\n\nIt would hold a site visit on Wednesday to reveal more, he said.\n\nDe Lille, Smith placed on special leave\n\nOn Tuesday, the DA announced that De Lille and Smith had been placed on special leave from party activities.\n\nThis came after De Lille lashed out at Smith on Monday via a press release.

Let us burn the fingers of those demanding a few pieces of gold in return for teaching posts. We are not saying it is happening. No. We are being cautious fully aware that bad apples exist. We urge authorities to consider schools in remote areas when deploying the new teachers to afford all pupils equal access to education.\n\nIn this environment where employment is hard to come-by, we urge teachers not to be selective. They ought to be passionate about their profession.\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [19, 5, 14, 12, 13, 6, 23, 4, 21], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [14, 12, 6, 5, 21, 19, 4, 13, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [19, 4, 6, 23, 21, 14, 13, 12, 5], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [12, 13, 5, 14, 19, 4, 21, 6, 23], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [12, 14, 23, 13, 5, 21, 15, 6, 4, 19], "scores": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Sarah Hyland said she has neither confirmed nor denied that Hayley is bisexual.\nFacebook/Modern Family airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.\nThe ninth season of the mockumentary premiered in September.", "text": "\"Modern Family\" star Sarah Hyland clarified the initial statement she made about her character Hayley Dunphy's sexuality.

These inequalities were less stark and visible until the 1980s. They have acquired an intimidating and entrenched disposition over the last two decades. \n \nWhat are the factors that explain this amplification in disparities? This article attempts to identify these and expose the state capture by the elites employing a distorted, biased framework of laws and regulations: \n \na) The rising share and pace of expansion of the capital and skill-intensive sectors of the economy, like finance, IT, telecommunication, energy and oil and gas, in which the less privileged sections of the population cannot participate meaningfully because the state did not provide them equal opportunity through quality education. \n \nb) Policies that have promoted or reinforced crony capitalism through the provision of artificial crutches, to protect some industrial enterprises from competition (under the legislative cover of the much-maligned SROs). Moreover, the state has not only turned a blind eye to the hoarding and formation of cartels it has also backed off when facing resistance to the widening of the tax net by some groups like small traders. \n  \nThe state has become a hostage to the perceptions of interest groups on how our political, bureaucratic and economic formations should be organised. \n  \nc) The institution of an unfair tax structure which has treated the same levels of incomes from different sources differently, reflected in light taxation (eg of capital gains in real estate and equities and a host of other commercial activities and sectors) and tax exemptions (eg the IPPs and the agriculture sector\u2014 in the latter case supplemented by subsidies on inputs like fertiliser, irrigation water and electricity for tube wells and support prices for wheat and sugar cane at higher than international prices). \n \nd) Perks and privileges like free or heavily subsidised plots in key urban centres to state functionaries and similar handouts to allies by the political leadership. A rapidly growing population, complemented by the real estate sector serving as a haven for parking black money, the prices of these plots prices rose exponentially, aided by the continuing legality of benami-held property. \n \ne) The non-transparent use of discretionary powers and authority with impunity by the political leadership whereby lavish gifts\u2019 of \u2018contracts and regulatory concessions\u2019 (eg relaxation of building and zoning regulations) have been bestowed upon friends and supporters. By becoming direct or indirect (through payoffs) stakeholders in real estate development the political and bureaucratic elites have made untaxed fortunes. \n \nf) The entry of a powerful lobby of commission agents and deal fixers of transactions involving public-sector corporations and agencies bred further corruption. \n \ne) Some economic actors, allegedly abetted by public servants, acquired affluence from illegal/ criminal activities (trade in drugs, arms and ammunition, smuggling, misdeclaration of prices of imports and exports and the \u2018hundi\u2019 market for foreign currency, etc). \n \nf) Rampant tax evasion of the resulting incomes and the protection of dysfunctional and tainted administrative systems reinforced the inequalities in favour of the segments of society mentioned. \n \nThe dominant ethos of policy favours and abuse of powers have triggered the creation of a political, social and cultural value system rooted in paternalistic and personal relations, nepotism and patronage and violation of laws. The state has become a hostage to the perceptions of these interest groups on how Pakistan\u2019s political, bureaucratic and economic formations should be organised, resulting in venality and the misuse of powers becoming institutionalised, leading to further imbalance in income and asset distribution. \n \nTo grasp the nature and scale of inequalities, the following data would be instructive: i) whereas the ratio in shares of incomes of the top 20 per cent and bottom 20pc households was roughly five to one in 2000 it had risen to beyond eight by 2015-16; ii) While this ratio was, say, eight, the ratio of tax incidence between the two groups was below two, reflecting the regressive nature of the tax regime that has been pursued and greater reliance on indirect taxes for revenue generation; iii) the cheapest imported luxury car costs 20 years\u2019 income of a household in the bottom 20pc! \n \nThese growing disparities have manifested themselves in the imports of luxury cars (and the resulting imports of parts and more petrol), designer clothes, expensive mobile phones, generators for domestic use, solar panels and food items, foreign exchange for financing foreign education and travel abroad for recreational purposes and deluxe-style pilgrimages. \n \nThe constitution and quality of economic growth as reflected in the items (goods and services) imported for consumption or to feed domestic production configurations has determined the composition and size of the economy and consumption patterns, and thereby the industrial structure, the production technology and the level and skill mix of employment. The free play of market forces has reinforced the inequalities. \n \nMeanwhile, cheap external inflows (because of fortuitous international events at various times) have managed to keep the state afloat. This has enabled postponement of basic reforms, with short-sighted elites happy with the augmentation of their personal fortunes derived from the implementation of such a strategy, while the rest of the country continued to operate below potential. \n \nTo conclude, the emerging sectors of the economy and discriminatory state policies and actions that favoured certain interest groups and classes have exacerbated income disparities. And its worsening has not only been the key determinant of the outcome on the external front but has also exposed the sustainability of the prevailing model and pattern of growth. \n \nThe soft options of the past (concessional aid, remittances, bounties that became available from events like the Cold War, the Afghan war, 9/11etc;) that enabled the elite to postpone fundamental restructuring of this crumbling state and associated political-economic ties, are not likely to be available in such abundance in future. Therefore, addressing the economic issues stemming from the consumption demands of those with large disposable incomes will eventually require basic, structural reforms to remove the constraints to a more equitable and sustainable growth path. \n \nThe writer is a former governor of the State Bank. \n \nPublished in Dawn, October 7th, 2\n\nNO ANNOTATIONS FOUND PREVIOUSLY"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [6, 23, 12, 21, 14, 5, 4, 13, 19], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 5, 14, 21, 12, 6, 23, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [4, 21, 6, 5, 14, 12, 23, 13, 19], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [13, 21, 5, 14, 6, 12, 19, 4, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 5, 21, 14, 12, 6, 13, 19, 23, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Spat between Patricia de Lille and JP Smith is sign of infighting in the DA.\nSotashe claimed that the DA wanted De Lille for the 'coloured vote'.\nHe said Smith did nothing without checking first with Western Cape Premier Helen Zille.\nThe ANC said it would also give him proof of alleged R9.2m spent on roofing in Bellville.\nSotashe claimed that the City of Cape Town boasted about clean audits.", "text": "The spat between Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services, JP Smith, is a sign of factionalism and infighting in the DA, the ANC in the Western Cape said on Tuesday.\n\n\"During the 2016 elections we told you that there is a cold war within the DA and you did not believe us,\" the party's chairperson in the Dullah Omar region Xolani Sotashe said at a briefing in Philippi East.\n\n\"Now we feel vindicated.\"\n\nSotashe accused De Lille of changing allegiances \"like a chameleon\", after moving from the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to the Independent Democrats (ID), and then agreeing to be absorbed into the Democratic Alliance (DA).\n\nSotashe claimed that the DA only wanted De Lille for what he called \"the coloured vote\".\n\n\"The marriage between De Lille and Helen Zille was not going to last,\" he continued.\n\nHe said Smith did nothing without checking first with Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, adding that he was \"ineffective\".\n\nThe ANC said it would also give the Public Protector's office proof of an alleged R9.2m spent on roofing in Bellville which was never done, even though the City had already paid for the work.\n\nIt would hold a site visit on Wednesday to reveal more, he said.\n\nDe Lille, Smith placed on special leave\n\nOn Tuesday, the DA announced that De Lille and Smith had been placed on special leave from party activities.\n\nThis came after De Lille lashed out at Smith on Monday via a press release.

Following is the statement made by H.E. Ambassador Reza Najafi at the Board of Governors of IAEA on \n\nIsraeli Nuclear Capabilities:\n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nIn line with the NAM position, the issue of Israeli nuclear capability was raised by distinguished ambassador of Kuwait on behalf of Arab Group, and while sharing their concerns on the issue, I would like to restate the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran as follows: \n\nThe Israeli nuclear capability with the exclusive military purpose has always been a source of serious concern for the peoples of the region and international community. The Heads of State or Government of the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM) in the Final Document of its 16th Summit expressed concern over the acquisition of nuclear capability by Israel, which poses a serious and continuing threat to the security of neighboring and other States. \n\nThey also condemned it for continuing to develop and stockpile nuclear arsenals. In the same document, they \u201creiterated their support for the efforts of the Arab Group in Vienna to keep the question of the Israeli nuclear capabilities under consideration\u201d at the IAEA. They urged that the continued consideration of this issue in the context of the IAEA is completely relevant. \n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nSince 1982, the IAEA has passed several resolutions, made decisions and called upon this regime to promptly accede to the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and put all of its clandestine nuclear facilities under the Agency\u2019s full scope safeguards. Furthermore, the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference recalled \u201cthe reaffirmation by the 2000 Review Conference of the importance of Israel\u2019s accession to the Treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards'. \n\nIgnoring the legitimate international concerns by refraining to adhere to the NPT, this regime with blind support of some countries, continuously advances its unlawful nuclear capabilities with the hidden involvement of certain States, in flagrant breach of all international norms and regulations. \n\nContrary to the statement made by the then Prime Minister of Israel on 11 December 2006, related to the possession of nuclear weapons by Israel which was strongly condemned by NAM, when asked by CNN, in a clear lie its current prime minister denied having nuclear weapons. It is crystal clear that clandestine nuclear weapon program of this regime not only jeopardizes the regional and global security but also seriously undermines the Agency\u2019s verification mechanism.\n\nAs it was also called by the NAM, there must be the total and complete prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material and facilities, resources or devices and the extension of assistance in the nuclear related scientific or technological fields to Israel. \n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran expresses its deep concern over the serious negative implications on security in the region as well as the reliability of the global non-proliferation regime whereby Israeli scientists are generously provided access to the nuclear facilities of certain Nuclear Weapon States (NWSs) where they gathered thousands of pages of documents on development of nuclear weapons. \n\nSuch access has been provided to scientists of a non-party to the NPT with an underground nuclear military program while nuclear scientists of NPT Parties have been assassinated all over the Middle East by terrorists recruited by this regime. Nuclear weapons in the hands of such regime with a history full of aggression, occupation and state-terrorism is a real threat to the international peace and security. \n\nMr. Chairman, \n\nThe failure of the NPT 2015 Review Conference due to the position of 3 countries, in support of a non-party to the NPT is a serious setback and regrettable. States Parties to the Treaty, in the first and second sessions of the Preparatory Committee of upcoming NPT Review Conference, held respectively in May 2017 here in Vienna and in April 2018 in Geneva, expressed their concern on such failure. \n\nTherefore, my delegation is of the view that pending the materialization of the international community\u2019s call for the adherence of Israel to the NPT without any condition and placement of all its clandestine nuclear facilities under the full-scope safeguards of the IAEA, it is quite reasonable that the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities, as a real threat to the international peace and security remains on the agenda of the IAEA.\n\nReporter: Hadi Nadri\n\n1396**1396\n\nFollow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [5, 14, 12, 13, 21, 19, 23, 6, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [14, 12, 19, 5, 4, 21, 6, 13, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [5, 13, 21, 19, 6, 23, 14, 12, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [12, 5, 14, 13, 19, 4, 21, 6, 23], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [14, 5, 12, 4, 6, 23, 13, 21, 19, 15], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}}, "summary": "Cadbury needed high - quality , slimline recycling bins to collect litter and recyclables throughout the site.\nThe Nexus miniseries 50 Recycling Bins are constructed from robust and durable materials for increased performance and long service life.\nThe bins are personalised with non - standard colours and custom graphics on the front of their bins.", "text": "Glasdon provided their Nexus\u00ae 50 Recycling Bins for Cadbury World, based in Bourneville, Birmingham. \n\nCadbury needed high-quality, slimline recycling bins to collect litter and recyclables throughout the site.

Smooth surfaces and a front-opening removable door ensures ease of use for the operator when cleaning and emptying. \n\nCadbury World stationed their Nexus 50 bins near to queues and waiting lines, to help combat litter in high-traffic throughout the tour. \n\nTo help increase recycling rates, as well as provide a litter outlet for their visitors, Cadbury World selected recycling bins for the collection of both plastic bottles and general waste. \n\nCadbury World decided to personalise their Nexus 50 recycling containers with non-standard colours and custom graphics on the front of their bins using Glasdon\u2019s personalisation service. They also chose to enhance their recycling containers with an optional A4 Sign Kit, to increase visibility of the bins for their visitors and encourage correct waste disposal. \n    Add to Project Board  \n Create a new project board: \n     Add to Project Board  \n Create a new project board: \n    View Street Furniture Product Entry  View Waste Management Solutions Brochure PDF"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [19, 6, 13, 23, 4, 12, 5, 14, 21], "scores": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 13, 6, 23, 4, 5, 14, 12, 21], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 4, 12, 23, 5, 13, 14, 19, 21], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [23, 5, 13, 4, 14, 12, 6, 21, 19], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [15, 5, 13, 4, 14, 23, 19, 6, 12, 21], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]}}, "summary": "Clay, 60, checked into a Las Vegas hospital last week initially as a precaution but, once there, tests revealed the actor had \"a partially blocked artery,\" his rep tells PEOPLE exclusively.\n\"He thought he pinched a nerve at the gym,\" the rep says.\n\"But once at the hospital he was told he had a partially blocked artery and underwent a stent procedure.\"", "text": "Andrew Dice Clay is recuperating after doctors discovered he had a much more serious condition following his hospitalization for dehydration and exhaustion. \n \nClay, 60, checked into a Las Vegas hospital last week initially as a precaution but, once there, tests revealed the actor had \"a partially blocked artery,\" his rep tells PEOPLE exclusively. \n \n\"He thought he pinched a nerve at the gym,\" the rep says. \"But once at the hospital he was told he had a partially blocked artery and underwent a stent procedure.\" \n \nThe rep adds, \"He's now stable and resting comfortably with his family at his Vegas retreat.

He is the stubborn mule who, after contracting motor neurone disease, refused to sit back from his ambitions as a film-maker and, assisted by friends and technology, directed the accomplished feature My Name is Emily . Clearly a man with a restless brain, Fitzmaurice \u2013 relying on an eye-gaze computer \u2013 also completed a memoir of his illness titled It\u2019s Not Yet Dark . Now it has become a moving, lively documentary. He\u2019s an example to us all. \n\nWithout imposing any gimmicks, director Frankie Fenton , an experienced television professional, has brought visual variety to his largely chronological retelling of an often-appalling story. He incorporates gorgeous mobile shots of the Irish countryside. A visit to Australia following diagnosis allows sunlight into a story that is already starting to close in upon the viewer. For a picture that has much to do with depletion, It\u2019s Not Yet Dark buzzes with all the right sorts of energy. \n \nTop talent fleshes out the credits and adds class to the package. Colin Farrell speaks Fitzmaurice\u2019s words with a mellifluousness that never dips into the melodramatic. Stephen Rennicks , frequent collaborator with Lenny Abrahamson, delivers an effective, unobtrusive score. \n  \n[embedded content] \n  An ordinary upbringing  \nAfter an introduction that lays out the complications of Fitzmaurice\u2019s condition \u2013 paralysed from the neck down, he breathes via respirator and communicates with a voice simulator \u2013 we drift back to hear about an ordinary middle-class upbringing. He was smart but he didn\u2019t try very hard at school. He and his dad loved watching classic cinema together. The most important voice, aside from that of the narrator, belongs to Ruth Fitzmaurice , Simon\u2019s wife (now an acclaimed author of a revelatory memoir). Early on she reveals that, in their first meetings, Simon came across as an arrogant jerk. She soon softened to him, but that initial impression hints at a strength of personality that will serve him well when the illness strikes. \n \nRuth relates the many hardships they were to face, but she is not allowed (or does not allow herself) to wallow in any sort of self-pity. The sense throughout is of a relentless drive forward. Halt and the earth might swallow them up. \n \nFollowing college and film school, Fitzmaurice directed a fine short that took him to the Sundance Film Festival. While walking the streets of Park City, Utah, a stubborn pain in his foot continued to nag. Nobody thought anything much of it. But a doctor eventually diagnosed the same disease that has clawed away at Stephen Hawking. \n Arctic explorer\u2019s beard  \nArchive footage leads towards a destination with which we are already familiar. Now wrapped in a sturdy, Arctic explorer\u2019s beard, Simon relies upon dedicated staff to keep him aloft. The film is good on the logistical and aesthetic details of that care. Ruth and Simon considered changing the American-tinged vowels of his voice simulator, but, by that stage, they reckoned it had become an immovable part of his personality. A visiting boffin explains how the technology functions. Later still, we get fascinating insights into how \u2013 making much use of storyboards and the admirable Liz Gill as support director \u2013 he managed to stay in control of My Name is Emily on set. \n \nThere is much wisdom in Fitzmaurice\u2019s text. (\u201cThe best part of living with MND is living,\u201d he wryly notes). As was the case with My Name is Emily , there are also, for this critic\u2019s taste, a few too many outbreaks of borderline-New Age inspirational sloganeering. Mind you, if any person should be indulged in that regard it is Simon Fitzmaurice.

The final ruling is available on the EPA's website. \n\n\"We appreciate the EPA's commitment to advanced biofuels and getting the Renewable Fuels Standard program back on predictable track,\" says Kaisa Hietala, Executive Vice President of Neste's Renewable Products business area. \n\n\"Neste MY Renewable Diesel is an ideal low-carbon fuel to meet the US renewable fuel standards, as it is fully compatible with existing fuel distribution systems,\" continues Hietala. \n\nMany public and private fleets in California use Neste MY Renewable Diesel to meet their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

Just like cancer, diabetes cannot be seen and in many cases have been developing and growing in your body for years without detection. Most people treat diabetes as a mild illness and fail to take care of it until it\u2019s too late. Thus often the two diseases are called \u2018silent killers\u2019. \u2018The two diseases also share certain risk factors, of which we cannot control certain factors such as age, family history and ethnicity, others are still manageable. Risk factors like obesity, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet and smoking also make you vulnerable to diseases and these can be controlled through well-timed intervention,\u2019 Dr Roshani Gadge, Consultant Diabetologist, Gadge Diabetes Center, Mumbai. \n\n\u2018An association between diabetes and cancer has been talked about for several years, but it is only in the recent past (about 10 years) that significant evidence has established the link between the two and has proved that insulin plays a crucial role here,\u2019 she opines. \n \nWhat makes us prone to diabetes? \n \nDr Roshni says, \u2018Almost 56 percent of our calories come from three sources that were non-existent when our genes were developing: \n Refined sugars (cane and beet sugar, corn, syrup, fructose, etc)  Bleached flour (white bread, white pasts, white rice, etc)  Vegetable oils (soybean, sunflower, corn, trans fats)  \nIt so happens that these three sources contain none of the proteins, vitamins, or omega-3 fatty acids needed to keep our bodies functioning. On the other hand, they directly fuel the growth of cancer. When we eat sugar or white flour \u2013 foods with a high glycemic index \u2013 blood glucose levels rise rapidly. The body immediately releases a dose of insulin to enable the glucose to enter cells. The secretion of insulin is accompanied by the release of another molecule called IGF (insulin-like growth factor) whose role is to stimulate cell growth. In short, sugar nourishes tissues and makes them grow faster. Furthermore, insulin and IGF have another effect in common: they promote the factors of inflammation which also stimulates cell growth and acts as a fertilizer for tumours to grow. \n \nThere is a good reason to believe the sugar rise in the blood contributes to the cancer epidemic, as it is linked to an explosion of insulin and IGF in our bodies. \n \nThe link between type II diabetes and risk of cancer \n \nIn case of type II diabetes, the body cannot make efficient use of the insulin \u2013 a condition known as insulin resistance. To compensate, the pancreas speeds up the production of insulin in your body. Consequently, insulin begins to build up in your bloodstream, which causes cells to divide, grow and spread \u2013 this may include cancerous cells, leading to the growth of a tumour. Those with Type 1 Diabetes have no insulin production at all and depend on artificially injected insulin, which can be more precisely controlled. \n \nStudies suggest that people with Diabetes (primarily Type 2) are associated with an increased risk of some cancers such as liver, pancreas, colon/rectum, breast and bladder cancers. Therefore, it is very important that you monitor and keep your blood sugar levels regulated. On the other hand, diabetes is also associated with a reduced risk for prostate cancer, some good news for men! \n \nImage source: Shutterstock \n Published: January 22, 2018 9"}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [21, 6, 23, 14, 5, 12, 4, 19, 13], "scores": [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [19, 5, 21, 23, 4, 12, 14, 13, 6], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [6, 19, 13, 12, 14, 4, 23, 5, 21], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [4, 14, 19, 21, 23, 6, 12, 5, 13], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [13, 4, 14, 12, 19, 15, 23, 5, 6, 21], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]}}, "summary": "To convict the jury must be sure:  Mr Jackson penetrated the complainant with his penis (It does not matter how slight or brief the penetration was), The woman did not consent to this And Mr Jackson knew she did not consent.\nUnlike the first three charges, the woman's consent is not relevant to this accusation.", "text": "To convict each of the men the jurors must be convinced the prosecution has proved all elements of the individual charges   \nThe jury in the rape trial of Ireland and Ulster players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding is due to start its deliberations on Tuesday. \n \nMr Jackson is alleged to have raped and sexually assaulted the then 19-year-old Belfast student in his bedroom during a gathering in his house in the early hours of June 28th, 2016.

To convict on this count the jury must be sure: \n Mr Jackson penetrated the complainant with his fingers,  The woman did not consent to this  And Jackson knew she did not consent.  \nCount 3 \n \nStuart Olding is accused of raping the woman by inserting his penis into her mouth on the same occasion. He says she willingly performed oral sex on him. To convict on this count the jury must be convinced: \n Mr Olding penetrated the complainant\u2019s mouth with his penis,  The woman did not consent to this  And Mr Olding knew she did not consent.  \nCount 4 \n \nBlane McIlory is accused of exposing his genitals to the woman directly after the alleged rape. The woman alleges he entered the room naked, thrust his penis at her and said: \u201cYou f**ked those guys. Why not me?\u201d Mr McIlroy says he entered the room fully clothed and the woman performed consensual oral sex on him. \n \nUnlike the first three charges, the woman\u2019s consent is not relevant to this accusation. To convict the jury must be convinced: \n Mr McIlroy exposed his genitals to the woman,  He intended her to see his genitals  And he intended her to be alarmed or distressed by this sight.  \nCount 5 \n \nThe charges against Rory Harrison are the most complex in legal terms. He is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police or omitting relevant facts which could have helped the investigation. Mr Harrison is accused of not disclosing relevant facts to officers when they took a witness statement from him on June 30th, 2016, two days after the alleged rape. These facts include: \n A text he received from the complainant in the hours after the alleged rape stating \u201cwhat happened was not consensual\u201d,  That he allegedly saw nudity on the night in question as demonstrated by a text he sent stating \u201cwent upstairs and there were more flutes than the Twelfth of July\u201d,  That he believed \u201cthings weren\u2019t going to end well\u201d after the alleged rape as demonstrated by a text he sent Mr McIlroy to that effect,  And that the complainant was significantly more distressed when he dropped her home in a taxi than he let on to police.  \nThe defence say he provided a truthful account and answered all questions put to him to the best of his ability. They deny he engaged in a cover-up to protect his friends. \n \nTo convict on this count the jury must be sure: \n Between June 27th and July 1st, 2016 Mr Harrison made a witness statement to police lying about his dealings with the woman or deliberating omitting relevant information,  It was possible that lie or omission could have perverted the course of justice  And that Mr Harrison intended to pervert the course of justice.  \nCount 6 \n \nMr Harrison is also accused of withholding information from police. Although it sounds similar to count 5, it is quite different and involves separate elements which must be proved by the prosecution before jurors can convict. Jurors must be sure: \n A rape offence was committed between June 27th, 2016 and October 5th, 2016,  Mr Harrison knew or believed a rape offence had been committed  And he knew or believed he had information which was likely to help with the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of the guilty party.  \nUnlike the other allegations which all stand alone, for the jury to convict on this count it must be sure a rape occured. If it acquits Jackson and Olding of rape it must return a not guilty verdict on this count too."}, {"map_quality_scores": {"Fluent": {"annotators_ids": [23, 12, 6, 19, 14, 13, 21, 5, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]}, "Understandable": {"annotators_ids": [14, 15, 12, 4, 19, 13, 5, 21, 6, 23], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]}, "Informative": {"annotators_ids": [12, 14, 15, 13, 4, 21, 6, 19, 23, 5], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]}, "Compact": {"annotators_ids": [23, 5, 12, 6, 4, 19, 14, 21, 13], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]}, "Overall": {"annotators_ids": [23, 15, 13, 14, 21, 19, 15, 4, 12, 5, 6], "scores": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3]}}, "summary": "Two families have built shacks inside the old church yard, others have each taken a section of the old building, and some have built partitions on the second floor.\nWhere she lived before she would find occasional domestic work.\nThabang Ngubane also built a small shack inside the church yard.", "text": "Ten of the 35 families evicted from a building behind Home Affairs in Nigel, who spent a week sleeping in the open, have been moved by the municipality to a deserted church on the R51 Springs road.

You see all the fans out in the park to see them. I never thought I'd see scenes like that in this World Cup. \n \n\"They can be absolutely proud. We did say before the game these lads have to take this opportunity because it may never come again. \n \n\"All I hope as I look at them now crying, disappointed, upset is they get another opportunity as good as the one they've just had.\" \n \n\"They're the youngest team in the tournament.

Photo: Reuters   \nFormer England defender Rio Ferdinand believes the youthful nature of England's squad proved to be their undoing in the semi-final. \n \n\"I think experience was a telling factor today,\" Ferdinand told the BBC. \"This Croatian team had medals all over the squad but now is not the time to knitpick. This bunch of players have brought the nation together and the fans haven't sung like this for years. \n \n\"We wanted this team to come out with an identity and a philosophy of playing, and I think they have done that. Where we were sat in the stadium, people around us were impressed with England's football and their ability to play out from the back. \n \n\"Kieran Trippier's delivery of the ball was brilliant and what a tournament he has had. There were question marks over Jordan Pickford but he was the best choice in goal and this team can develop into something very strong. I have been an admirer of John Stones for a long time, and he defended unbelievably today. We have got a very inexperienced young squad but they have grown and will continue to do so.\" \n \nEx-England striker Alan Shearer also tried to find the positives amid England's anguish. \n \n\"We said before the tournament that if they gave absolutely everything in every game, everyone at home would be happy,\" said Shearer. \n \n\"England got off to a very good start and dominated the first 45 minutes but Croatia stepped 10 yards further forward in the second half. \n \n\"Luka Modric bossed the midfield and we could not get near him with his deft touches and passes, he was superb and a man of the match performance, a vital cog for them. We lacked experience to get someone on him and stop him. Croatia did not panic when they fell behind. \n \n\"Kieran Trippier was brilliant in the tournament and so was Jordan Pickford, especially with his delivery. Harry Kane was a bit quiet in the knockout games and he had a chance that he could not put away \n \n\"So many positives to take out of the tournament, we did not expect to get to the quarters and will go home after this without heads held high.
