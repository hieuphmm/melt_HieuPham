Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika also declared a week of mourning for the Polisario leader, whose group is based in Tindouf, in southern Algeria.\n\nThe death of Mr. Abdelaziz, leader of the Polisario Front for four decades, comes at a time of growing tensions over the fate of the Western Sahara. The Polisario Front has fought for four decades for independence for the vast, mineral-rich territory on Africa's Atlantic coast, which was annexed by Morocco after Spain withdrew in 1975.\n\nMorocco now considers the territory its \u201csouthern provinces\" and has pumped funds into the area's development over the years. Morocco is also becoming increasingly assertive on the topic with the United Nations, which has worked for years to help settle the issue of Western Sahara's status.\n\nMr. Abdelaziz was born in 1948 in Smara, which is now in Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara, and led the Polisario Front, which he helped found, since 1976, according to Algeria's state-run APS news agency.\n\nThe issue of Western Sahara has prompted new friction between two North African neighbors, Morocco and Algeria. Algeria supports the Polisario Front, and like numerous other African countries recognizes the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic it defends.\n\nThe Moroccan government has proposed wide-ranging autonomy for the region, but the Polisario Front insists on self-determination through a referendum for the local population -- as called for in U.N. resolutions.\n\nMorocco expelled most U.N. civilian staff last month after the U.N. chief used the word \u201coccupation\" to refer to the situation following a visit to a camp for Western Sahara refugees in southern Algeria.\n\nIn April, a top member of the Polisario Front, Bachir Mustafa Sayed, warned that war is possible over the disputed territory if the U.N. Security Council fails to set a timetable for a vote on self-determination.\n\nMr. Abdelaziz warned in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that Morocco will have \u201ca green light to a military aggression\" unless the Security Council imposes \u201creal and direct pressure\" on Morocco to restore the U.N. mission's work.

While the U.S. typically enjoys a surplus in April due to tax-filing season, this year's surplus was $50 billion more than last year's and the fifth-largest monthly surplus on record. The boost in receipts narrowed the U.S. budget deficit for the previous 12 months to $460 billion, from $510 billion in March and $499 billion in the prior year. It was the lowest annual deficit since last November and the second lowest since September 2008.\n\nOver the past 12 months, revenues are running 9% above their year-earlier level while spending is running 7% higher.\n\nThe figures illustrate how, despite growing unease over income inequality, the taxes that America's rich are paying on their rising incomes are yielding a windfall for the U.S. Treasury. Payroll taxes rose 6% from a year earlier in April, while other individual taxes, including those on capital gains and self-employment incomes, were up 18%.\n\nCorporate profits have also boosted federal coffers. For the fiscal year that began last October, gross corporate taxes are running 16% ahead of their year-earlier level. For the first quarter of 2015, estimated tax liabilities by corporations rose 6% from a year earlier, suggesting solid corporate profits and a pickup in capital spending outside of the energy sector this year, economists at Barclays said Tuesday.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office forecast in March that the federal deficit would rise to $486 billion this year, from $485 billion last year. Analysts say the latest figures suggest the deficit forecast will fall given the surge in receipts.\n\nHigher revenues mean that despite increases in government spending this year, primarily from entitlement programs, \u201cit's virtually certain that more progress in lowering the deficit is likely this year,\" said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group.\n\nThe latest figures could also shape potential negotiations between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans over how to set government spending levels for the coming fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Mr. Obama has insisted that spending rise above the across-the-board caps that Congress agreed to four years ago and that any increases in the defense budget should be matched by increases in other domestic spending.\n\nRepublicans in Congress last week approved a budget resolution, which doesn't require presidential approval, to keep in place the curbs. But they added nearly $90 billion in spending, using a separate account for war funding that isn't subject to the sequester, to placate defense hawks who are uneasy over military spending restraints.\n\nThe Obama administration has argued that deficits can be contained below 3% of GDP by focusing on steps that boost economic growth by expanding the labor force. In their budget resolution last week, Republicans proposed $5 trillion in spending cuts to eliminate the deficit over the coming decade.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress has yet to raise the federal debt limit. The Treasury Department has been using emergency measures since mid-March to avoid breaching the ceiling. The Treasury hasn't yet said how long it might be able to do that, but the CBO estimated in March that those measures should last until October or November.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com"}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 10, 12, 15, 16, 13, 18, 4, 6, 14], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Christa D'Souza on champagne.\nAmanda, now a French wine expert, says she's inspired a low-calorie drink.\nSugar is actually the crack cocaine.\nAmanda Thomson's new sugar-free Champagne.", "text": "Low calorie champagne contains the same amount of alcohol with almost half the calories of a regular glass\n\nAs a style editor with over 30 years experience in the fizz-guzzling fashion industry there's not much that Christa D'Souza doesn't know about champagne.\n\nOne things she DOES know is that she doesn't actually like the decadent drink all that much.\n\n'It reminds me too much of all those dreaded press launches I had to go to when I first started out in magazines, all those over made-up PR ladies with lipstick on their teeth and slightly skew-whiff hair-dos and so forth\u2026' the 53-year-old British journalist told Get The Gloss when they asked her to review the latest skinny champagne to be causing a stir.\n\n'I don't like champagne, or \"poo\" as we used to call it in the early 90s, but with the dilemma of maintaining one\u2019s, um,\u00a0 girlish figure and being a highly functioning alcoholic.

The 'dosage' is the sugar added at the end of fermentation to 'finish' the Champagne and 12 - 17 per cent sugar is standard.\n\nWhilst low sugar, and therefore low calorie, fizz is not a brand new idea - some of France's most prestigious brands offer extra dry versions of their biggest sellers - it usually comes with a hefty price tag that even regular champagne drinkers find hard to swallow.\n\nNow a new kid on the posh plonk block, created by British ex showbiz journalist Amanda Thomson, is offering a guilt-free alternative at half the price.\n\nAmanda, now a French wine expert trained at Le Cordon Blue in Paris, says she was inspired to create a low-calorie drink after her\n previous job as a showbiz reporter made her worry about gaining weight \nfrom attending VIP parties.\n\nWorking with champagne maker Alexandre Penet she has created the no sugar Brut Nature Cuv\u00e9e Grand Cru, which is now selling via her Thomson and Scott website for \u00a349 per bottle and contains just 60 calories per glass.\n\nThe drink is described as 'high end Grand Cru with almost half the calories' - which sounds like the holy grail for thirsty fashionistas and showbiz hounds doing the rounds.\n\nContributing Vogue editor Christa D'Souza and her fashion friends put the latest brand to the test\n\nAmanda said:'We know that the British have a history \nof loving champagne, but in today\u2019s more calorie-conscious market, I\u2019ve \nfound a producer who delivers a deliciously dry champagne, but with no \nadded sugar.\n\n\u2018The fashion crowd especially loves the idea of drinking fizz with less fat.\u2019\n\nSo what is the verdict?\n\nChrista says: 'I seriously think it is going to be the NEW THING.

Because this Grande Cuvee champagne is so very, very very BRUT, you don\u2019t get the sickly sweet taste and nor do you wake up feeling you need to take the whole day off or you seriously might die.

If you are watching your calories, it might be one of those situations where you are better off having one glass of something fabulous rather than two glasses of something that doesn't taste great.

We were in Donald Trump's office, and we spoke with him briefly. Carrieand her family spoke with him briefly. We all got in and spoke together, and we were hashing things out. But I never really felt 100 percent, and I never really felt truly heard. I was hoping for the best.\n\nAfter the press conference when I went back to my hotel room, I just really sat down with myself. I don't believe she is going to comply with the contract, and I wasn't really happy with what happened at the press conference. I slept on it, and I woke up the next morning and was watching \"The Today Show.\" I was sitting there watching her basically still make excuses. My biggest problem is that she's never really taken responsibility for herself. She's constantly pointing the finger at everybody else.\n\nGalanos: You're talking about the pictures?\n\nMoakler: Yes, the pictures. I couldn't stand by it anymore, and on top of it, the lying continues. Our contracts as state licensees were basically made invalid. For me, it was just too much.\n\nGalanos: When you say the lies, are you talking about the pictures where she says it was a windy day and the wind blew her top open?\n\nMoakler: Yes, in that particular point. It's such a complicated story with so many factors weighing in. For me, it was always about the contract. I didn't go to New York to get her decrowned. But I was hoping at some point in time at that press conference that there would be some accountability and there wasn't.\n\nGalanos: What happened in that meeting? Did you and Carrie talk it out? Did it get heated?\n\nMoakler: There was tension [and] it was a little heated. It was the first time since Miss USA that we were all together in the room. She had read articles, I had read articles, she had seen interviews, I had seen interviews, there were feelings. At the end of the day, I've known Carrie for a long time. She stayed in my home, she was my friend. We cared about each other so there was a lot of hurt, but we were talking, we were working things out. It went very quickly.\n\nGalanos: You say \"you cared\" [and that] she was your \"friend.\" Is the relationship over?\n\nMoakler: I'm a mother. I have three children, and I still care about Carrie. I think she's been exploited and used as a tool for some of these other people's agendas and these different organizations. My biggest complaint is that it was never addressed and it was never reprimanded. It makes my contract as a state director void for my contestants. She was rewarded for that, and I don't think that's fair.\n\nGalanos: Let's back track to the beginning. When you heard that answer -- and you're a same-sex marriage proponent -- were you angry with Carrie? Did you want her to lose at that point? What was your reaction?\n\nMoakler: I wasn't angry; I was a little hurt. A great deal of our sponsors are gay and have supported her. I did not physically go and see her after the pageant, but I did write her. I congratulated her. I told her I was happy that she stayed true to herself, but I also conveyed that I think she hurt some people that really loved and cared about her.\n\nGalanos: Why can't someone give that answer to that question and still be Miss USA?\n\nMoakler: She can, she absolutely can. But there were gay judges on her panel of judges, and there were some people that didn't like that answer. One of the things you have to take into consideration is your judges.\n\nGalanos: Do you think she lost it because of that answer?\n\nMoakler: No, and it's been shown through the scores that she wasn't winning in points at that particular point. This has never been about her opinion. We all want her to have her opinion. She is able, and this is where the First Amendment argument has come into this.\n\nThe thing is, this is a young girl who was on a public stage, and I don't think she was prepared or ready to handle the backlash of the other side, and there was another side that has the same right to voice their opinion of not liking what she said. There was no persecution. It's just that there are other people that are allowed to disagree.\n\nGalanos: When you were in the office with Donald Trump and you're about ready to go to the press conference, he says \"Carrie's keeping the crown.\" Did you object at that point?\n\nMoakler: I knew she was keeping the title before going in there. I had said to him, \"What happens if she continues to breech her contract?\" And he said, \"I'll fire her.\" I said, \"What happens if more pictures come out?\" He said, \"I'll fire her.\" I thought he would convey that in the press conference, but I didn't see that. It was more finger-pointing and basically being honored again. It was a hard pill to swallow. You have to understand that taking big business in New York back to California makes it hard for me to run my pageant.\n\nGalanos: Is there something you could have done to calm things?\n\nMoakler: [If she had spoken to me after the pageant,] I would have stayed by her and supported her and found out what the next steps were that she might have wanted to take. I would have helped her with some of the media training. I would have made sure she was more educated on the topic she was speaking about so when she did do these interviews and she was handling all of this pressure and heated debates [that] she would be able to speak intelligently and clearly. She would be able to express her opinions. I would be able to convey to her how to understand why she's getting attacked and where these things are coming from. There were so many organizations that latched on to her, I didn't even stand a chance."}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 15, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 4, 5], "scores": [0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Phoenix VA hospitals show higher mortality, dangerous infections.\nPhoenix VA hospitals among top performers in VA's internal measurement.\nVA targets 'facilities that fail to demonstrate improvement'.\nVA inspector general has publicly used SAIL data for hospitals.\nVA database offers less variability in medical outcomes.\nVA: more medical outcomes should stay private.", "text": "The Phoenix facility at the heart of the crisis at the Department of Veterans Affairs is among a number of VA hospitals that show significantly higher rates of mortality and dangerous infections than the agency's top-tier hospitals, internal records show.\n\nThe criticism that precipitated last week's resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has focused largely on excessive wait times for appointments across the VA's 150-hospital medical system.

Houston's VA hospital, ranked as a two-star hospital, had a 47% higher acute-care mortality rate than the five-star hospital rate.\n\nThe VA has disclosed a variety of health-care quality data for its hospitals, often including more information than the great majority of private hospitals make public.\n\nIt has built several Internet portals that allow the public to see information about infection rates, among other things, and how it compares with agency goals.\n\nBut the database published by the VA is less detailed and offers less ability to compare hospitals than SAIL.\n\nFor example, the Phoenix VA doesn't appear to be an outlier on the VA's main comparison website, www.hospitalcompare.va.gov.\n\nBy comparison, Pennsylvania has published hospital-specific medical outcomes from private and other hospitals for decades. They showed great variations initially, but a look at the current data set appears to show less variability among institutions.\n\nThe VA has long been on the cutting edge of medical advances, including in its gathering and disseminating of data.\n\nIt pioneered a national surgery quality-improvement program in recent decades that rigorously measured its own surgeons' performance. By 2011, it also took the extraordinary step of beginning to publish some of its hospitals' medical-complication and surgical death rates, with an eye toward ratcheting up excellence.\n\nAt the same time, the wide variation in outcomes among facilities sparked an internal battle over how much detailed data should be made public, said current and former VA doctors.\n\nWilliam E. Duncan, who supervised publication of medical outcomes until his 2012 departure, said in an interview that he urged that more data be posted regardless of the impact.\n\nBut his superior, VA Under Secretary for Health Robert Petzel, argued that the more detailed outcomes should stay private at the VA, senior VA doctors say.\n\nEfforts to reach Dr. Petzel, who was forced out of office recently, weren't successful.\n\nAmid the spat, Dr. Duncan was forced out of the agency in 2012, he said. The VA spokesman didn't answer questions about Dr. Duncan's departure.\n\nDr. Duncan, now living in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, said the VA system of measuring and publishing outcomes was designed with lofty aspirations: \"The goal was not for hospitals to be average performers. The goal was to be in the top 10%.\"\n\nHe is upset by the recent complaints about the VA.\n\n\"Our patients have little recourse, and they rely on our staff to tell them the truth,\" he said. \"We can't forget that medical quality is not just access to care.\"\n\nAs for the relatively poor results from Phoenix, this was no secret within the department, he said. \"It was in their own data.\""}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 10, 12, 13, 6, 14, 15, 4, 16, 18], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Fed to prefer rates in May.\nFed rate increase justified by run of consistently solid economic data.\nInvestors don't know when Fed will shrink bonds.", "text": "The recent selloff in U.S. government bonds took a breather Friday as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen suggested a March interest-rate increase was likely but dismissed concerns that the central bank was moving too slowly to tighten monetary policy.\n\nIn prepared remarks for delivery in Chicago, Ms. Yellen said a move in March was \"likely appropriate\" given an improving economy and rising inflation. But she also noted that inflation is still running \"somewhat below\" the Fed's 2% annual target despite a temporary boost from higher energy prices. The nuanced message provoked a similarly mixed reaction from the bond market, which quickly recouped losses suffered in the initial moments after Ms. Yellen's remarks went public.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark two-year Treasury note settled at 1.304%, compared with 1.322% Thursday, while the yield on the 10-year note climbed to 2.492% from 2.489%\n\nYields move in the opposite direction of bond prices.\n\nAfter months of discounting the chances of a March rate increase, investors abruptly changed their outlook this week, responding to a series of Fed officials who appeared ready to take action.\n\nFederal-funds futures, used by investors to place bets on central bank policy, put the chances of an interest-rate increase this month at 86%, up from 78% Thursday and 27% at the end of last week, according to CME Group.\n\nThe prospect of an imminent rate increase has taken a toll on short-term bonds, pushing the yield on the two-year note to its highest levels in more than seven years.\n\nYields on longer-term bonds have also climbed but remain below their levels from December, when the 10-year yield reached 2.6%.\n\n\"It's not unusual that if you're suddenly pricing in more, or sooner, rate hikes that the pressure is going to be largely on the short end,\" said John Canavan, market analyst at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nSellers of short-term bonds can be buyers of longer-term bonds, but appetite for long-term debt could also reflect confidence among investors that a more active Fed will be able to control inflation, he added.\n\nMs. Yellen was one of several Fed officials who spoke Friday. Departing from his peers, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he would prefer to raise rates in May rather than March.

Well, according to a controversial new theory from an Irish weight-loss expert, perhaps not as many of us as you'd think.\n\nSociologist Dr Bernadette Rock believes that desperate dieters often want to retain their flab -- even if they don't realise it.\n\nDublin based Dr Rock outlines her surprising theory on a Huffington Post blog, where she says that, despite common wisdom, there are many benefits to being overweight.\n\nShe goes on to suggest that when dieters struggle to stick to regimes,\nthey're often subconsciously sabotaging their own attempts \nbecause they want to retain their excess pounds.\n\nDr Bernadette Rock believes that acknowledging the reasons dieters might like being overweight will help them achieve their goal\n\n'There are advantages to remaining overweight. If you are not aware of these benefits \nand why you're holding on to your extra weight, then no amount of \ndieting will keep those pounds at bay for good,' writes the sociologist, who runs HeyDay World, a non-dieting weight loss programme in Dublin.\n\nTalking to the MailOnline about her controversial theory, Dr Rock explained, 'It surprises many people that being overweight can serve a function.\n\n'While a part of you feels bad about being overweight and despises having extra weight, there may be another part of you that is holding onto it,' she says.\n\nDr Bernadette Rock, whose surprising theory on weight loss challenges the usual dieting theories\n\nSo what are these hidden benefits of carrying some extra inches? Dr Rock outlines four classic examples from clients:\n\n1. \"My reason for not doing things in life has been my weight. When I lose it, I won't have an excuse to put off life, such as applying for another job, or even getting on a flight\"\n\n2. \"Having extra weight means I can blend into the background, without being the focus of attention, and I don't feel that I'm 'on show'\"\n\n3. \"Weight makes me feel protected from other people. I think I might feel vulnerable if I lost it.\"\n\nDr Rock also refers to her personal weight loss experience. 'I recall feeling anxious or nervous about the increased personal power that I felt as the weight gradually fell off me,' she admits.\n\nBut says, 'I\u2019ve had some angry responses to my blog from people who believe I am blaming them for their weight. This is partly because there is such a culture of blaming overweight people.\n\n'Instead this blog seeks to encourage people to step back with awareness and bring more understanding and non-judgement to their weight and eating habits.'\n\nWhat Dr Rock hopes is that readers will use this theory to help them on their weight loss journey.\n\n'If you have recently \nlost weight and fear that you will gradually regain the pounds, then it \nis crucial that you look at the reasons why you might be holding onto \nextra pounds,' she says.\n\n'During all of my 16 years dedicated to chronic dieting and feeling out of control around food, one of my enduring beliefs was that being slim meant I would be lighter, happier and confident.\n\n'After a few weeks of being 'good' and in control (as opposed to tucking into toast with melted butter, biscuits and any food not nailed down) the result, when I stepped on the bathroom scales, was that my weight had dropped,' she says.\n\nDon't blame the biscuits! A new theory suggests failing dieters WANT to be overweight\n\nBut she admits, 'Weeks of being good were suddenly unraveled in a moment of stress or anxiety. And isn't it amazing how much food you can eat in five minutes?'\n\nThe Irish expert then explains, 'I was desperately seeking slimness but never thought to ask myself \"Why have I put myself in the position of being overweight again?\", \"Is a part of me holding onto my weight?\"\n\n'Although a part of you does not want that extra weight and desperately wants to shed it, is there another part of you holding onto that weight?\n\n'You might never have considered these questions: Why have you chosen to be overweight? What's in it for you by being overweight?'\n\nIt's not surprising that when Dr Rock asks her clients if there are reasons they want to remain overweight, they usually respond with expression of incredulity and disbelief.\n\nBut she believes there are advantages to remaining overweight, which dieters have to confront before successfully shedding pounds.\n\n'A new slim body means a smaller version of yourself. You no longer have the fat to protect you,' she says.\n\n'You may feel more fragile and vulnerable. Having extra weight has protected you. Without it you may feel exposed. That's one reason why many people who lose weight regain it.'\n\nDr Rock concludes, 'If you are not aware of the benefits of your weight and your concerns about letting it go, you will struggle to reach and maintain a healthy weight.'\n\nDr. Bernadette Rock is director of www.heydayworld.com, which offers groups and online weight-loss programmes"}, {"annotators_ids": [10, 15, 5, 12, 13, 16, 18, 4, 6, 14], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], "summary": "Give your Valentine a smile.\nLate 19th Century Music Box.\n't change a hair '.", "text": "1. \"Sweet comic Valentine, you make me smile with my heart.\"\n\nWell worth a grin: silly sterling silver and gold vermeil twisty straws from Tiffany's, a charmingly extravagant surprise.

Education impacts everything that we do in the city. It really is a fundamental right and it's a path out of poverty,\" Taveras said. \"We're working to see what's going on in each other's city and to share solutions and help adapt them to our own city.\"\n\nThey hope to take home lessons learned in each city in order to address gaps between wealthier areas with great schools and poorer neighborhoods where schools struggle. The tour will continue through March.\n\n\"We have an achievement gap between children of color and white kids that quite frankly, if we don't address and begin to address effectively with some sense of urgency, will threaten the real vitality and freedoms of this country,\" Hancock said.\n\nHere are lessons the four mayors learned by working with their cities' schools -- and through their own experiences as students.\n\nNot all A's are created equal\n\nBefore he was mayor of Sacramento, Kevin Johnson had gotten a basketball scholarship to Berkeley and thought he was a good student, he said.\n\nBut during his freshman year at University of California Berkeley, Johnson realized that getting A's and B's in high school didn't mean he was prepared for college.\n\n\"I was in an English class with 30 kids and they were all talking about a word -- the word was 'euphemism' -- and 29 of those kids knew what the word meant,\" Johnson said. \"I was the only kid who did not know the word 'euphemism' and I remember thinking, 'Am I in the wrong class?'\"\n\nJohnson realized then that an A in one school might not equal to an A in another, and even students with good grades can be in for a rude awakening when they go to college. (After graduating from Berkeley, Johnson went on to play twelve seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Phoenix Suns.)\n\n\"Far too often a child's educational outcomes are determined by her or his ZIP code, and that's the case in Sacramento, too, and this has led to an unacceptable achievement gap,\" Johnson said, describing how slow they've been to close the gap between white and black students' scores. \"It's horrifying.\"\n\nDenver Mayor Michael Hancock described a similar experience.\n\n\"I got into college, as well as many of my peers, and we realized we were not where we needed to be, we were behind some of our peers,\" he said. \"So we had to do special classes and programming to get caught up and really put in the extra effort.\"\n\nHe struggled with writing and math early in college, he said, which makes him consider what hard-to-spot problems might exist in Denver's schools.\n\n\"That's where we begin to see some of the cracks and some of the gaps that may not be as apparent in the primary system,\" said Hancock, who is an advocate of school choice. \"Families should be able to pursue the best possible educational opportunity that is available to them, no matter where that opportunity exists in the city,\"\n\nTeachers can change lives\n\nSan Antonio Mayor Julian Castro was just a few years into his school career when he began to understand the power of a good teacher.\n\n\"In the first or second grade, I had a teacher who gave me extra homework to do and she explained that she had confidence that I could do the extra work and that made me feel great about myself,\" Castro said. \"I got to excel in school and that was the beginning of my feeling good about achieving academically.\"\n\nProvidence Mayor Angel Taveras said he became a lawyer because his third-grade teacher, Mrs. Dorothy Donaldson, told him he could.\n\n\"She was someone who asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up and I told her that I wanted to be a lawyer. She asked me 'Why?' and I told her that I wanted to help people. She made me repeat it to anyone and everyone who would listen,\" Taveras said.\n\nThe same teacher suggested Taveras test for a gifted program, which allowed him to take more intense math classes, and eventually led him to a more challenging school.\n\nIt's never too early to start learning\n\nTaveras, himself a graduate of the early childhood education program Head Start, said he has worked to improve early childhood literacy in his city by introducing programs such as Providence Talks.\n\nThe program aims to close the \"word gap.\" Research shows low-income children hear millions fewer words in the early years of their lives than their peers in middle- or upper-income homes.\n\nThe program provides low-income children with recording devices that count the words they're exposed to each, and coaching parents and caregivers on how to improve their children's vocabularies. The devices work in several languages, including English and Spanish, and is expected to launch in 2014.\n\nProvidence Talks was the winner of the $5 million Bloomberg Philanthropy Mayors Challenge, a contest created by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to draw out ideas from city leaders.\n\nCastro described how San Antonio residents had recently voted to fund full-day pre-kindergarten for more than 22,000 of the city's 4-year-olds over the next eight years. Castro said he hopes it will prevent students from falling behind, experiencing the frustration of falling behind and perhaps dropping out.\n\nChildren's educations can begin even before they're enrolled in school, he said.\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that students are prepared when they start school,\" Castro said. \"We have so many young people who are not read to and they're not prepared when they start pre-k.\""}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 14, 18, 4, 6], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], "summary": "NBC announcer played spot-celebrities in Olympics.\nOlympics viewers outraged after NBC cuts away.\nThe man who started NBCFail on Twitter.", "text": "(CNN) -- An NBC sports announcer was playing the classic game of spot-celebrities-in-the-stands during the gold medal Olympics match in men's basketball when this happened:\n\n\"I know I'm gonna put that picture on Facebook,\" Bob Fitzgerald said as the camera showed a young man with curly hair and a red hat, according to a video posted on the blog Deadspin.\n\n\"We've got every executive of note, it seems, worldwide, attending these Games.\"\n\nThe problem: The man in the audience wasn't Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.

But whether that was the best course of action financially remained a question.\n\n\u201cHe was very set on that timeline,\" says Susan Pool, a senior vice president of TrueNorth Inc. in Wichita, Kan., which manages $422 million for 273 clients. \u201cThe difficulty was that despite that target, it wasn't actually the best course given the couple's financial situation.\" His employer offered a pension and a generous 401(k) match. However, the man was still uncertain about his ability to fund his family's lifestyle once he stopped working. Not only was Social Security eligibility still years off, but he and his wife still had a mortgage and credit-card debt and were making payments of $2,500 a month on those liabilities.\n\nThe adviser explained that a better option would be to continue working until at least age 62, or another four years. During that time, the man could work to pay down some or even all of the couple's debt and add to their savings. When he did retire, their debt burden would be greatly reduced and he would have the welcome benefit of an additional income stream from Social Security.\n\nBut the man was adamant about retiring sooner. He had experienced a number of recent health scares and was determined to alleviate the stress of his job. To boost his pension payout, he planned to pick the payout option that would pay his wife only half of his benefit if she outlived him.\n\n\u201cClients don't always embrace your recommendations and you always want to be respectful of those decisions,\" explains Ms. Pool. \u201cThe goal for an adviser becomes working within that framework to help them find the most prudent solution.\"\n\nWhile Ms. Pool agreed that an early retirement was achievable, she told the man that his current pension strategy deserved another look. Given the debt the couple was carrying, she explained, it was critical that he choose a payout option which guaranteed his spouse 100% of his annual pension benefit in his absence, even though that would mean a smaller initial benefit.\n\nStill, the client needed more convincing. During an earlier conversation the client had told the adviser how important is was to both him and his wife that they be able to remain in their home throughout retirement. Given the man's health history, explained the adviser, he had to consider the distinct possibility that he would predecease his wife. Should that happen, with only half of his pension, she would struggle to make their mortgage payments and keep the house. That scenario resonated with the man.\n\n\u201cHe recognized the importance of taking a little less now in order to ensure his wife's income stream and ultimately her financial security in the future,\" says Ms. Pool.\n\nWhen he retired at 60, the man opted for his pension with the full survivor benefit. To supplement income before he could begin taking Social Security, the man and his wife created a budget that limited discretionary spending. That freed up more liquid resources and allowed the couple to begin paying down some of their debt.\n\nLess than four years after retiring, the man died.\n\n\u201cUltimately, that decision regarding his pension made a tremendous difference in her life,\" says Ms. Pool. \u201cThe passing of her husband was devastating, of course, but the sense of security she had in her circumstance going forward helped carry her through that time without him.\""}, {"annotators_ids": [15, 16, 10, 13, 5, 6, 14, 18, 12], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Pentagon official: shooting at Defense headquarters A random incident.\nBullet fragments found in Pentagon windows.\nJohn Patrick Bedell shot and killed at Pentagon.", "text": "Washington (CNN) -- A Pentagon official said he believes the shooting early Tuesday at the U.S. Defense Department headquarters was a \"random incident.\"\n\n\"We are looking at all the possibilities,\" Steven E.

That part of the Pentagon was empty at the time of the shooting, as it is in the process of being renovated.

Last year, Mr. Ryan had wanted to include 55-year-olds in the revamp but backed off in the face of unhappiness from Republicans who believed the party had made a pledge to people 55 and older to keep Medicare untouched. Instead, in his fiscal 2014 proposal, only people 54 and younger automatically were eligible.\n\n\"It's a concern to some of our more moderate members,\" said Rep. Tom Cole (R., Okla.), a member of the Budget Committee, in an interview Monday.

Changing Medicare, moreover, remains a political third rail.\n\n\"I see this as a way of Paul Ryan trying to get Republican votes for a budget resolution,\" said Joe Antos, a health-policy expert at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMr. Cole said he expected Republicans to rally around Mr. Ryan's proposal that the budget deficit be eliminated in 10 years, partly through changes to federal health and safety-net programs. \"What has to happen going forward are entitlement reforms,\" he said. \"We still have a ways to go to get to 218,\" he said\u2014the votes needed to pass the budget.\n\nThe House GOP budget, like last year's, would state that beginning in 2024, workers born in 1959 or later would be able to choose between traditional Medicare or private plans obtained on a Medicare exchange.

Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said Wednesday she saw little chance of winning convictions in the remaining trials. \"As a mother, the decision not to proceed on the remaining trials is agonizing,\" she said in front of a mural of Mr. Gray in West Baltimore. \"However, as a chief prosecutor elected by the citizens of Baltimore, I must consider the dismal likelihood of conviction at this point.\"\n\nProsecutors revealed the decision to drop charges in court ahead of the trial of Officer Garrett Miller, who had been charged with illegally arresting Mr. Gray and failing to secure him with a seat belt in back of a police van. Mr. Gray sustained a fatal spinal cord injury while being transported after his arrest for allegedly possessing an illegal knife.\n\nProsecutors based their case against the officers largely on their failure to put Mr. Gray in a seat belt or to get him medical care during the roughly 40-minute ride.

He came here from Louth Village, County Louth, in the midlands of Ireland to follow my mother, who had come here on a job search.\n\nMy father stumbled upon the horse and carriages on Central Park South and hit the jackpot. He was a third-generation blacksmith and went to work immediately as the stable hand and blacksmith to the carriage trade. He would work all day, fixing problems with the carriages and then shoeing horses.\n\nThe stable owner allowed him to drive a carriage on weekends to earn extra pay. He worked like this until 1967, when he purchased his first carriage. This is the origin of my family tradition. The horse and carriages have put the bread and butter on my family's table since 1967 and I intend on keeping it that way for years to come.\n\nThe iconic carriage industry is a big part of what makes New York special. We are a gateway to enjoying the city, providing a slow-paced tour of Central Park, the greatest park in the world. We carry visitors from all over, providing them with a memory that lasts a lifetime. In my 26 years driving a carriage, I have participated in hundreds and hundreds of engagements, weddings, anniversaries, proms, birthdays, movies, TV commercials and sitcoms -- and provide a special moment for all my regular customers.\n\nI am the proud owner of two draft horses -- Tyson, an 11-year-old Morgan and Percheron cross, and Jokinson, a 7-year-old Percheron mare. Tyson is my \"lead\" horse, which means he is my best horse. Draft horses such as mine and the others used in the carriage trade have been born and bred, for centuries, to pull loads.\n\nOpposite view: Ban New York's horse-drawn carriage rides\n\nOn average, my horses work alternate days, so they generally work three to four days a week. I have owned many horses in my 26 years in the business and have never been involved in an accident nor have any of my horses been seriously injured.\n\nThe horses that pull the carriages are treated exceedingly well. The stables themselves are open to inspection 365 days a year. The Department of Health inspects them four times a year, and the New York Fire Department conducts an inspection at least once a year. Every horse gets checkups from a licensed New York state veterinarian and a minimum of five weeks out of the city to pasture. If a horse goes across state lines he must be seen by a vet before leaving and before returning. Our industry wants transparency when it comes to our horse care. We welcome it.\n\nIn 2010, the Carriage Operators of North America invited Harry Werner, an equine veterinarian and former head of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, to check out the horses' working and living environments in New York. He says he and other veterinarians paid their own way and found clean stalls, excellent veterinary care and food, and no inhumane conditions or neglect. He told The New York Times recently that the \"demeanor of the horses was, to a one, that of a contented horse.\"\n\nThere are 68 licensed carriages, 220 licensed horses and about 300 licensed drivers, of which 160 are employed. The carriage industry has 144 pages of regulations that cover everything from where we can operate to how much insurance we should carry. The industry is monitored by five agencies: the ASPCA, Health Department, Mounted Police division of the NYPD, Department of Consumer Affairs and the Parks Department.\n\nOn January 1, the new mayor of New York was sworn in to office determined to end my beloved industry, one that is also loved by New Yorkers and people all over the world. Mayor Bill de Blasio believes there is no place in New York City for horse drawn carriages and wants to replace them with antique-style cars. He says the business is inhumane, but has flat-out refused to see how the horses are treated or meet with the men and women who work with them.\n\nMembers of Teamsters Local 553 union have extended an open invitation to him and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito to visit and see for themselves how the industry works, and to this date they have declined.\n\nThere are horse and carriage rides available in many U.S. cities: Chicago, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Salt Lake City, Honolulu, Boston and Charleston, South Carolina, are just a few. Horse people around the world are watching to see what happens here in the next few months. Banning the practice in New York could set a precedent that would put hundreds of people out of work. I will fight the ban.\n\nWe have a legitimate, thriving, well-regulated industry. It is 99% walk-up: People love the chance to get up close and pet a beautiful horse in an urban environment. The horse is the star.

Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is likely to side with calls for the group to adhere more closely to its self-imposed production ceiling at Thursday\u2019s meeting of OPEC oil ministers, according to a Gulf official familiar with the Saudi position.\n\nSupport for such a move, which would be based on tighter compliance with OPEC\u2019s existing output limit as opposed to an outright cut to its production target, was coalescing last week at a meeting of OPEC advisers, according to several of those present. With oil prices having recently stabilized at around $80 a barrel following a 30% slide since the summer, some within OPEC have seen less urgent need for the group to take stronger action.\n\nBut as late as last week the Saudis\u2019 likely approach at Thursday\u2019s meeting was unclear to most members.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia will likely go for a rollover\u201d of the current ceiling, the Gulf official said on Tuesday. A call for strict compliance would be \u201can option they would go for.\u201d But Riyadh\u2019s intentions haven\u2019t been clearly telegraphed to other members, and it could decide to go a different route by the time of the Thursday meeting.\n\nOPEC members have engaged in an unusually frantic round of shuttle diplomacy ahead of this week\u2019s gathering, with some poorer countries calling for deep supply cuts to boost oil prices. Brent crude slid 1.2% to $78.53 a barrel on Tuesday after a meeting among Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC members Russia and Mexico resulted in no agreement to cut oil production.\n\nOPEC agreed to limit its collective output to 30 million barrels of oil a day three years ago. But its actual production has regularly spilled over as each member has pushed to maintain their share of global oil markets. Closer compliance would imply a supply cut of around 300,000 barrels of oil a day compared with October levels, according to OPEC technocrats who met last week.\n\nBy some distance OPEC\u2019s largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia has been unusually reticent in the run-up to this week\u2019s meeting. Its oil minister Ali al-Naimi refused to answer questions about the country\u2019s stance when he arrived in Vienna on Monday.\n\nThe kingdom appears reluctant to bear the brunt of any OPEC action on its own. Earlier this month Mr. al-Naimi told Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister Rafael Ramirez that the kingdom wouldn\u2019t cut its oil output alone, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBut a supply cut of around 300,000 barrels a day is unlikely to satisfy some OPEC members, such as Venezuela and Iran, who need oil prices well above $100 a barrel to balance their government budgets.\n\nOPEC has, in the past, taken far more drastic action to boost oil prices. It slashed production quotas by 4.2 million barrels a day in 2008 following the global financial crisis. An OPEC production cut of around 1.5 million barrels would be needed to tighten global oil markets next year, according to oil analysts at Barclays.\n\nCurrent oil prices \u201caren\u2019t acceptable, of course not,\u201d Iraq\u2019s oil minister Adel Abdul-Mehdi told reporters upon arriving in Vienna. \u201cA means should be used to raise the prices,\u201d he said.\n\nBut officials from Persian Gulf countries, which can generally balance their budgets with lower prices, are concerned deep output cuts would prove self-defeating as any rise in oil prices would only encourage further U.S. shale oil production. OPEC members could then lose market share and higher prices would \u201cmake it easy\u201d for the U.S. to pump more, one Gulf oil official said.\n\nU.S. shale oil producers need oil prices in the range of $53 to $78 a barrel to break even, meaning most are profitable even with prices at their current level, according to estimates presented at an OPEC technical meeting last week.\n\nAnother problem for OPEC is sagging global oil demand growth, especially in key Asian markets like China. Industrialized countries also have increasing amounts of oil in reserve, with inventories on average high enough to cover 59 days of consumption in the first half of next year compared with a normal average of around 53 to 54 days, according to OPEC officials.\n\nWrite to Beno\u00eet Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com, Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com"}, {"annotators_ids": [10, 16, 5, 6, 14, 15, 4, 12, 13, 18], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Geely 2014 net profit up 46%.\nGeely is potential domestic brand winner in China.\nGeely proposed a final dividend.", "text": "HONG KONG\u2014Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. said Wednesday its 2014 net profit plunged 46% to 1.43 billion yuan (US$229.3 million) from CNY2.68 billion a year earlier due to a drop in overall sales and an unrealized foreign-exchange loss at its Russian subsidiary. \n\nThe Hong Kong-listed Chinese car maker, based in Hangzhou, said revenue also fell, by 24% to CNY21.7 billion, because of slower sales and deteriorating political and economic conditions in its major export countries.

comes as NHS England reveals emergency departments have not achieved the benchmark in England since July 2013.\n\nIt comes as the latest figures, published today, show performance is getting worse.\n\nIn the week ending March 1, 91 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in A&E before being discharged or admitted to a hospital ward - short of the 95 per cent target.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust think tank today warned\u00a0A&E departments across England are 'near breaking point', as they called for an end to the fixation with the four-hour waiting target\n\nIt marks a slight fall from the previous week, when performance was 92 per cent.\u00a0\n\nBut authors of the Nuffield Trust report argue that while the four-hour target has 'played an important part in improving patients' experiences', it is just one part of a complex system of urgent care.\u00a0\n\nThe report argues a set of 'richer performance indicators' should be considered alongside the weekly waiting time performance figures.\n\nNigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, and the report's co-author, warned: 'England's A&E system is near crisis.\n\n'With the financial squeeze set to continue, there is no relief in sight if we keep up the current approach.\u00a0\n\n'We need to rethink our assumptions as many of the \"magic bullet\" solutions suggested miss the point.\n\n'It's not about more people turning up, but about a system with a squeeze on hospital space and staff, which needs to get better at discharging people safely and on time.'\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEvery minute of every day, an average of 40 patients arrive at emergency departments in England.\n\nThe speed with which people move through A&E 'has come to be regarded as a sentinel marker of the health care system'.\n\nThe chair of the British Medical Association, Dr Mark Porter, agreed, adding the four-hour wait has become 'disproportionate'.\n\nResponding to the Nuffield Trust briefing, he said: 'Doctors want to treat patients on the basis of their individual need, rather than an arbitrary target.\u00a0\n\n'Moving away from a system that prioritises targets above all else to one which takes a wider view of how services are performing would improve the quality of patient care by preventing rushed admissions, or leaving those most in need waiting longer for treatment.\n\n95 per cent \u2013 the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in A&E before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital.\n\n92 per cent \u2013 average performance against the four-hour target by major A&E departments in 2014.\n\nThree hours 43 minutes \u2013 the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving A&E.\n\nTwo hours 17 minutes \u2013 the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is sent home after leaving A&E.\n\nMore than one hour, four minutes \u2013 how much longer on average a patient over the age of 75 spends in A&E compared with those aged under 75.\n\n'By fixating on one narrow measurement, we risk focusing on the symptoms rather than the causes of rising pressure on A&Es, which are linked to wider pressures across the NHS and social care sector.\n\n'Cuts to social care mean hospitals have become a holding place for many older patients who can\u2019t be discharged because there is simply nowhere for them to go.\u00a0\n\n'This \u2018exit block\u2019 leads to bed shortages and patients waiting for hours on trolleys to be admitted. Outside of hospitals investment in general practice is declining while demand is on the rise and more care is moved into the community - this simply isn\u2019t sustainable.\n\n'We can only get to grips with pressure on A&Es if we look at health and social care in the round, and ensure every part of the system is fully resourced and working well.'\u00a0\n\nFocus on A&E performance has intensified since the start of the year, as 'unprecedented' winter pressures saw medics face a worsening situation.\n\nIn January figures revealed A&E waiting times had plummeted to the lowest level in a decade.\n\nBut the authors of the Nuffield Trust report point out A&E is only part of a broader urgent care system.\n\nGP practices, out-of-hours services and the telephone service NHS 111 all have key parts to play.\u00a0\n\nThe four-hour target counts the patients who spend a total of less than 240 minutes between arrival and leaving the department, having been either discharged or admitted to an inpatient bed in another part of the hospital.\n\nThe authors said: 'The target has played an important part in improving patients' experiences of care at A&E.\n\n'Before the target was introduced, 12-hour waits were not uncommon.'\n\nWhen the benchmark was first introduced in 2004, performance began to rise.\n\nIn 2005-06 the target, then of seeing 98 per cent of patients within four hours, was met for the first time.\n\nIn 2010, the expectation was relaxed slightly, with the target lowered to 95 per cent of patients who should be treated and discharged or admitted within four hours.\u00a0\n\nThe report notes a range of pressures placed on A&E departments, but states the most significant issue  'is not the numbers of people presenting at A&E, but the ability to discharge patients safely and quickly from the hospital as a whole'\n\nThe pressure on the urgent care system is caused by high bed occupancy rates, tight resources and staff facing increasing strain, the report states.\n\n'There is no doubt that the system is near breaking point,' they wrote.\n\nBut there are other signs of the impending crisis, which will be accelerated by the 'continued financial squeeze'.\n\nThe number of patients waiting on trolleys for more than four hours before being admitted to hospital has almost trebled, and delayed ambulance handovers at the doors of A&E have risen by more than 70 per cent.\n\nThe think tank highlight the latest problems in A&E 'are part of a well-established decline since 2012'.\n\nBut they argue the picture is not as straightforward.\n\nA&E \u2018waiting\u2019 time\u00a0\n\nThe length of time a patient spends in the A&E department between being seen by A&E staff and either being admitted or discharged.

A repeated theme in American history, says Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University, \"is Americans believing the country is in decline and then finding ways to rebound from both the fear of decline and the problems that gave rise to that fear.\"\n\nThere is reason for optimism, says Kazin, who specializes in populist movements and is the editor of The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History.\n\nFor one thing, populist movements similar to, for example, Tea Parties, have reared up repeatedly in American history to rail against social inequities and faltering financial systems. But rather than heralding the end of the republic, he says, they \"often spur politicians to make changes that in the end make the country stronger.\"\n\nWhat optimism? For another view, click here\n\nAmericans apparently understand this: Of the 86 percent in the survey who thought the government was broken, 81 percent say that it could be fixed.\n\n\"Most Americans are still optimistic about the future of the country,\" Kazin says, \"and even of politics.\"\n\nKazin's most recent book is \"A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan.\" He is also co-editor of Dissent magazine.\n\nHe talked to CNN.com last week (the interview has been edited for length).\n\nCNN: You have said that the United States is doing rather well, and that what is in decline is a myth that America will always be richer, freer, and superior to other nations. So the country is not in decline?\n\nKazin: I think we are in trouble, but that's not the same as saying we're in decline. We have an economic crisis, unsolved problems, our political situation is deadlocked, many Americans are unhappy with the government.\n\nBut we've been there before. In the 1930's there was such a period: the Great Depression. And what came afterward was victory in World War II and then the greatest sustained economic boom in American history.\n\nOne of the continuing themes in American history is Americans believing the country is in decline and then finding ways to rebound from both the fear of decline and the problems that gave rise to that fear. I see no reason to believe that won't happen again.\n\nCNN: Why do some people think America's greatness is waning?\n\nKazin: Many Americans believe that the United States is immune from history, that we have always been the greatest nation and are destined always to be the greatest nation -- and if we aren't living up to that promise, our politicians are doing something wrong. But the United States is doing well from the perspective of most of the rest of the world.\n\nIf decline means that we are not the mightiest economy in the world by a long shot, then we might be declining. But it's also quite possible that what we're evolving into is being part of an interdependent world economy, which includes several powerful economic centers --including Europe, China, Japan -- and if we can all get along together, it's quite possible that it'll be better for Americans rather than worse.\"\n\nCNN: How would it be better?\n\nKazin: We would specialize in certain goods and certain services and other countries would specialize in others. That's the way a world economy is supposed to work.\n\nWe have tended to see our position vis-\u00e1-vis the rest of the world as a zero-sum game: if we are in decline, then the other countries must be gaining on us and that means we're worse off, that our economy will decline and we'll be vulnerable to threats from abroad.\n\nThere have been periods in history where several powerful nations have been able to prosper together. [For example] roughly the period from the 1870s to World War I. That was also known as the Age of Empire, so the U.S. and European nations were conquering other peoples. But history doesn't produce eras of unambiguous joy or unambiguous sorrow, it's always more complicated than that.\n\nCNN: Can you talk about periods in history that resemble this one, but in which the country has miraculously pulled itself together and become better?\n\nKazin: There was a lot of fear of decline in the 1890s: a nationwide railroad strike, small farmers in the south and west joined the People's Party; the populist movement was gaining large numbers of adherents who accused the powers that be of a conspiracy against the interests of the common people.\n\nCNN: What happened?\n\nKazin: What happened was the depression ended and prosperity returned, and the United States soon became the most powerful industrial nation on earth.\n\nCNN: And what about the People's Party?\n\nKazin: Some Populists rejoined the mainstream political system, but the populist movement was very beneficial in pointing out problems that needed to be addressed. The Populists helped build support for national regulation of the financial system -- which resulted in the Federal Reserve System -- as well as the income tax and the Tillman Act of 1907, which banned direct corporate contributions to candidates.\"\n\nCNN: Why do most of the fears of America's decline seem to come from the political right wing and not as much from the left?\n\nKazin: Barack Obama is in power and most people on the left supported him and so they are ambivalent about opposing him now; if he fails, they will have failed. The whole idea of a populist movement is rail against the establishment, in this case, the party in power.\n\nConservative ideas have been the dominant ones over the past 40 years, the way liberal ideas were dominant from the Great Depression to the late 1960s. The left doesn't have institutions that can generate mass protests right now.\n\nJust as with the original populists and the labor insurgency of the 1930's, the actual demands that are raised by the populist movements don't usually get met but the issues that are raised by those movements often spur politicians to make changes that in the end make the country stronger.\n\nCNN: So do you discern this vibe of pessimism in the culture -- a population beaten down by wars, a lousy economy, joblessness, etc.?\n\nKazin: Not beaten down. I think people are worried -- as they are in any recession, as they are when the political system seems not to be delivering solutions to problems people know exist. But there are a lot for ways in which the nation is quite strong.\n\nFirst of all, we have a very vibrant culture that is popular all over the world -- in sports, in entertainment -- our universities are considered the best in the world, people come from all over to study in the United States.\n\nAnd this is still the country to which most people would like to emigrate. Millions of people aren't trying to get into Russia, or Nigeria, or Japan.\n\nWe're not going to return to manufacturing inexpensive goods anytime soon -- but at the same time we'll still produce high-tech goods, we have service industry that we export around the world -- people who build things. We still have some of the best engineers in the world, and I think once we realize that we have to produce green technology, we'll be exporting that around the world.\n\nThis recession was fairly deep and millions of people are still suffering. But compared to the Great Depression it's been rather mild and short. I think the stimulus plan helped, I think bailing out the investment firms and the auto companies was also necessary. Morally, those huge Wall Street bonuses are reprehensible. But, absent a government takeover of the financial sector, keeping Wall Street in business was essential to any recovery.\n\nIn every downturn, the government has stepped in to help stabilize things, and in every downturn, it's worked.\"\n\nCNN: And you think that will be the case again.\n\nKazin: The one thing I point to as decline is the gap between the richest Americans and average Americans has increased quite a bit. There are a lot of reasons for that, but in a society where most people consider themselves to be middle-class that we are \"one people,\" that gap should be troubling.\n\nIt helps to generate a certain kind of populist rage--about those bonuses, for example. Few Americans want an equal distribution of income, but most do believe in economic fairness, and so they get angry when one group seems to be gaming the system.\n\nWill this mean decline? Not for the nation as a whole, but it may increase cynicism that there's nobody able to solve our problems."}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 16, 5, 10, 12, 15, 6, 4, 14, 18], "scores": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Nick Gordon: Whitney Houston's daughter was victim of foul play.\nNick Gordon's disturbing video shows Bobby Kristina in pain.\n'I 've begged Gordon to stop '.\n's mother, Dr Phil, claims Nick Gordon's life 'hangs in the balance'.\nNick Gordon under investigation for attempted murder of niece.\nGordon's CPR Marks found on face and arms.\nBobby Brown's tears turn to anger.\nBobbi Kristina used drugs to substitute Roxicodone.\nThere were times when she would be knocked out.", "text": "Nick Gordon, the troubled fianc\u00e9 of Bobby Kristina Brown, has defended himself against allegations that Whitney Houston\u2019s daughter was the victim of foul play, Daily Mail Online can reveal.\n\nSpeaking to Dr Phil McGraw Gordon, 25, said: \u2018I lost the most legendary singer ever and I\u2019m scared to lose Krissy.

Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil\n\nBut on learning of Gordon\u2019s emotional, mental and physical state Dr Phil could not \u2018in good conscience\u2019 go on with the interview.\n\nAccording to Gordon\u2019s mother, Michelle, who was by her son\u2019s side during the highly emotional intervention, \u2018Nicholas is at a breaking point. He cannot bear not being without Krissy, by her side. He\u2019s dealing with it by drinking. I\u2019ve begged him to stop.\u2019\n\nDr Phil told Gordon, who admitted to having taken Xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting: \u2018Nick, you\u2019re out of control. You\u2019ve threatened suicide. You deserved to get some help because if you don\u2019t, you know you\u2019re going to wind up dead.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018You\u2019ve got to get yourself cleaned up. You got to man up and straighten up.\u2019\n\nYesterday DailyMail.com revealed that, barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with Dr Phil, Gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk. The disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by Dr Phil as \u2018exponential.\u2019\u00a0\n\nIn the show, due to broadcast Wednesday, a weeping and wailing Gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry for everything.\u2019\n\nAsked if he still intended to kill himself he said: \u2018If anything happens to Krissi I will.\u2019\n\nHe said: \u2018My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.\u2019\n\nIn recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills.\n\nGordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.'\n\nInstead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab.\n\nDr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.'\n\nGordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive \u2013 at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed.\n\nShe described her son as 'at breaking point.'\n\nShe said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt.\n\n'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.'\n\nLeaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt\u2026and to get clean and sober.'\n\nHe added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.'\n\nQuestions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub.\n\nJust two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events.\n\nShe posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!'\n\nLeolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show.\n\nTough to watch: The young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer\n\nIn her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece\u2026.We have strong evidence of foul play.'\n\nMarks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived.\n\nAnd speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].'\n\nRailing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fianc\u00e9e's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.'\n\nAccording to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier.\n\n'I hate Bobby Brown!'\u00a0His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital\n\n'Are you drinking?'

He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, \"Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs.\"\n\nGordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fianc\u00e9e continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma.\n\nIt is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina \u2013 Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia.\n\nUnlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation.\n\nWhile Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged.\n\nIn an interview with The Sun \u00a0a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone.\n\nSounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on.\n\n'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs.\n\n'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.'\n\nTheir relationship was also very volatile.\n\n'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her.\u00a0\n\n'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.'\n\nAccording to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.'\n\n\u00a0\n\nTroubled relationship: A friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone"}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 10, 15, 5, 6, 14, 16, 18, 4, 12], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Principal of high school which lost 244 students in Sewol ferry disaster removed.\nSewol accident: 12 remain missing, 292 dead.", "text": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The principal of a high school, which lost 244 students and 10 teachers in the deadly Sewol ferry disaster in April, has been removed from his post, according to the local education office.\n\n\"I cannot reveal detailed reasons for his removal because it is personal information, but it is regarding the Sewol accident,\" said an official with the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education.\n\nThe second-year class from Danwon High School was on a school trip on the ill-fated ferry on April 16.

Most of them were orphans, while others had a parent unable or unwilling to look after them.\n\nA South Korean missionary living in China, known only as M.J. to protect his identity, tried to help the youngsters and has broken his silence to CNN.\n\n\"This one child used to live with his father,\" he explained. \"One day his father went into a North Korean military base trying to find food but was caught and beaten to death on the spot.  The child witnessed this ... his mother then told him not to come home and threw rocks at him to keep him away.\"\n\nRodents 'a luxury'\n\nThe youngsters survived by foraging for scraps in trashcans. Fish bones and discarded rice were mixed to make a porridge, while rodents were considered a luxury.  When M.J. first met some of them in December 2009, they had frostbite on their hands and toes from living in an old abandoned building where temperatures plummeted to as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius.  Some of them had injuries from beatings by security guards and merchants when they were caught stealing food.\n\nOne of the nine, a 20-year-old man, told M.J. he wanted to live in China as \"even beggars in China do not go hungry.\"\n\n\"These kids were suffering from malnutrition and disease,\" recalled M.J.  \"They had been living in quarters with bad sanitation ... also they all seemed to have suffered in one form or another from tuberculosis.  Because they were suffering from malnutrition, their growth was stunted.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Report describes North Korea 'atrocities'\n\nM.J. and his wife offered to help the youngsters leave China for Laos -- a landlocked country in South-East Asia -- and then onto a third country, perhaps South Korea or the United States to claim asylum.  It is a route that is well traveled by defectors, and the missionary couple had already helped other North Koreans escape to a better life that way.\n\nLiving in fear\n\nThe nine lived with the couple and several other North Korean defectors in China for almost two years in constant fear of being discovered by the authorities. They could never leave the house during this time. China doesn't treat North Koreans in its territory as refugees and usually sends them back across the border.\n\n\"The children had been fugitives for a long time so they were used to this situation,\" he said. \"We had a bed which was buttressed with quite a few books on the bottom as legs.  The kids would go under the bed and kick out the books, so the bed would sit low and it would not look like anyone was hiding under it.\"\n\nThe couple tried to organize adoptive parents for the youngsters in the United States but without success.  And so the long trip to the Laos border began.\n\nThe youngsters experienced some firsts along the way: One defector celebrated his birthday for the very first time; they visited an amusement park, which was a new experience; and they played barefoot on a beach for the first time. Finally, they were able to enjoy simple pleasures many children across the world take for granted.\n\nREAD MORE: Reunited after 40 years\n\n\"As we lived with these children, I saw them change,\" M.J.'s wife, who also asked not to be identified, said. \"They started having hopes, they started dreaming and I know they were happier.  I was overjoyed to have done something worthwhile.\"\n\nThe escape\n\nAfter successfully getting six other defectors out of the country to safety via other routes, the missionary couple paid a broker to transport the remaining nine across the China-Laos border because they had no papers or passports. On about May 10 this year, they embarked on a journey that would take them through the jungle in the dead of night to avoid detection. This journey would ordinarily take 40 minutes, according to the missionaries, but this time it took four hours due to heavier than usual border security that day.\n\nBut crossing the border proved to be the easy part. On a bus en route to the capital, an unexpected police search changed the course of events. The youngsters were detained and then investigated for more than two weeks by Laotian immigration officials because of their lack of paperwork. M.J. admitted the police search surprised him as it had never happened with previous refugees he had helped pass through the country.\n\nM.J.'s wife said they repeatedly called the South Korean Embassy in Laos for help.  \"We pled our case with the embassy because this was not just about one life but nine lives of young people ... for the embassy it was extra work and a burden to them and why should they care about these children from North Korea?\"\n\nM.J. said embassy officials told them to wait and do nothing to jeopardize things as Laos authorities were working to process the youngsters.  He said no-one from the embassy visited them in eighteen days.\n\nBitter truth\n\nOn May 27, the Laos authorities told the youngsters to pack as they were being sent to South Korea.  M.J. said they were so happy they all shouted for joy.  Years in hiding seemed to finally be over.  But the bitter truth of the situation soon became clear.\n\nThe missionary couple was prevented from following the children and instead locked in a room at the immigration offices for two hours.

Seeking shelter on his way home, he clambered into a large skip.\n\nAn hour later the bin lorry arrived to collect the skip outside a bus station and Mr Ogden, who had probably fallen asleep, was crushed to death by the vehicle\u2019s mechanical compressor, Bradford Coroner\u2019s Court heard.\n\nCoroner Dominic Bell recorded a verdict of accidental death related to alcohol and drug use.

Bonnen, an Illinois resident, is accused of using Twitter to tell another user: \"Who said sleeping in a moldy apartment was bad for you?

Horizon is seeking $50,000 in damages.\n\nLegal experts say such Internet-related cases are being watched closely because they confront new and unaddressed areas of American law.\n\nFor example, how should a libel case be handled when it comes to social media? How can society balance accountability with free speech? And if information -- from private thoughts to public data -- is so readily available, how do we define what constitutes privacy?\n\nA time of 'cultural shift'\n\nLegal experts said it's difficult for the law to keep up with emerging technology.\n\n\"Generally, it is at least five years behind technology as it is developing,\" said Andrea Matwyshyn, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, who tracks the intersection of law and technology.\n\nThere are several reasons why the law tends to play catch-up, experts said.\n\nThe first is that it's typically difficult to predict or anticipate technology innovations. Think of the music-sharing battles that began -- and are still going on -- after the advent of Napster.\n\nAnother reason is that it's difficult to handle cases that deal with the Internet and the Web because it confronts a fundamental schism: Is the Web a unique, separate space or is it really an extension of real space?\n\nThat concept might be a little bit abstract, but think of it this way: When a person dies, a house, property or car owned by that person can be passed on, relatively easily, to a family member or an identified heir.\n\nBut what about online property like account profiles, passwords and digital content?\n\n\"We really haven't thought about this much because there haven't been many generations of users with copious digital assets to even trigger the need to think about what happens if they pass away,\" Matwyshyn said.\n\nAnother challenge for the law is the way the Web crosses state and international borders. Let's say a Facebook user in England sues another user in Australia for defamatory comments posted on the site. Who has jurisdiction over the case, which country's laws should be applied: England's, Australia's or those of the United States, where Facebook is based?\n\nOne last hypothetical: Let's look at a Facebook or Twitter network of 10 people. Half of them are co-workers; the other half are not. One co-worker is offended by something another co-worker said. Do harassment laws apply? Does the company that employs some of the people have any liability?\n\n\"There's an increasing breakdown of the traditional social boundaries between workplace and homelife, and personal and public information,\" Matwyshyn said. \"It's a time of cultural shift and this is going to take a while to stabilize itself and shake out.\"\n\nThat process, seemingly, has begun.\n\nAnonymity and immunity\n\nIn August 2008, a user of Blogger.com, a Google subsidiary, created \"Skanks in NYC.\"\n\nThe blog assailed Liskula Cohen, 37, a Canadian-born cover girl who has appeared in Vogue and other fashion magazines, by featuring photos of Cohen captioned with derogatory terms.\n\nCohen sued Google to learn the name of the anonymous blogger on the grounds that the post was defamatory and libelous. A New York Supreme Court judge ordered Google to reveal the anonymous blogger's name, and Google complied.\n\nThe case provided insight into the debate between the competing values of privacy and free speech, said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst.\n\n\"You have a robust debate on a million different subjects every day on the Internet,\" he said. \"But on the other hand, is that a license to damage people's reputation with knowing falsehood?\"\n\nThe courts are trying to strike a balance between the two, Toobin said.\n\n\"There have been a lot of cases about trying to get behind the anonymity of the Internet,\" he said. \"What the courts are ... saying is that you have to show good reason, you can't just frivolously ask.\"\n\nNicholas Thompson of Wired magazine said such cases make it clear that anonymity on the Web does not necessarily guarantee a measure of immunity.\n\n\"The more people learn about it, the more they're going to realize that laws do apply online,\" he said.\n\n'A world without anonymity'\n\nIn 2006, Stacy Snyder was a 25-year-old single mother hoping to begin a career as an educator. She had finished her coursework and was a student teacher. Yet Millersville University, located in Pennsylvania, wouldn't give her a degree.\n\nSnyder filed a lawsuit alleging the school denied her a degree because administrators discovered a photo on her MySpace page that showed her wearing a pirate's hat and drinking from a plastic cup, with the caption \"drunken pirate.\"\n\nShe lost her case.

Haldeman Jr. will take the helm of the government-backed mortgage company, becoming Freddie Mac's fourth chief executive in less than a year.\n\nAs reported, Freddie Mac directors chose Mr. Haldeman to become CEO three weeks ago, although Freddie Mac wouldn't confirm reports at the time because the appointment was subject to approval by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, which regulates Freddie and its main rival, Fannie Mae. That approval came recently. Mr. Haldeman, the former chief executive of mutual-fund manager Putnam Investments, takes the helm during a tumultuous time for the company. Freddie and Fannie were seized by the government in September after mounting loan defaults led to enormous losses. Both companies now operate under conservatorship, a legal process that gives FHFA the power ordinarily held by shareholders and boards. In March, Freddie said it would need a $31 billion injection of capital from the Treasury after receiving nearly $14 billion late last year. The government has agreed to pump as much as $200 billion into each company to keep them afloat.\n\nDespite their financial woes, the companies are still required to play a vital role in foreclosure prevention while also providing a steady flow of capital to banks to make new mortgages. Together, Freddie and Fannie own or guarantee about half the $11 trillion in home loans.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Haldeman, 60 years old, said he enters the job with his \"eyes wide open\" to the fact that he will head a company firmly under the thumb of federal regulators.\n\nAs chief executive of Putnam, Mr. Haldeman was credited with boosting morale and regulatory compliance. He joined that company at a time when regulators were scrutinizing mutual-fund trading abuses. Poor morale is a problem at Freddie Mac, where the company's 6,000 employees have seen several years of turmoil from accounting scandals and loan losses, as well as a steady exodus of top managers. Freddie was rocked in April when its acting finance chief, David Kellermann, a longtime employee, was found dead in what was ruled a suicide.\n\nMr. Haldeman becomes the fourth chief executive to run Freddie since last September, when the government pushed out Richard F. Syron. Mr. Syron's successor, David Moffett, resigned after just six months in the post. The company's chairman, John Koskinen, has served as interim CEO since March.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com and Jessica Holzer at jessica.holzer@dowjones.com"}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 13, 16, 15, 6, 10, 14, 4, 12, 18], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "Sumo wrestling scandal involves gambling.\nJapanese sumo mafia to decide on Nagoya tournament.\nFormer sumo wrestlers featured on national television.\nSumo association admitted to illegally betting on baseball.\nMcDonald's Japan: 'We hope' sumo will become clean.", "text": "TOKYO\u2014The latest scandal to rock the sport of sumo wrestling involves gambling, reports of Japanese mafia involvement and a 29-year-old hairdresser who specializes in topknots.\n\nThe country's sumo association said Monday that the disclosures could force the cancellation of next month's grand tournament. The sport's largest corporate sponsor\u2014a maker of traditional Japanese soups\u2014said it would cancel its advertising in next month's tournament, displayed as banners paraded around the ring. Sumo wrestling, the Japanese national sport steeped in hundreds of years of ancient rituals and discipline among its plump practitioners, has been shoved under a spotlight in recent months due to a plethora of scandals that have involved top wrestlers in drunken brawls and smoking marijuana.\n\nIn the latest revelation\u2014which has caused almost as much uproar in Japan as Tiger Woods's infidelities in the U.S.\u201465 of the sport's 700 active sumo wrestlers have admitted to illegally gambling on baseball and other games, said a Japan Sumo Association spokesman.\n\nThe Japanese media, including the nation's largest daily Yomiuri Shimbun, have also reported that some of the gambling was through yakuza, the Japanese mafia.\n\nThe sumo association spokesman said he couldn't comment on whether gangsters were involved but added that the association is cooperating with a police investigation of the matter.\n\nA hairdresser by the single name of Tokoike, who styles sumo wrestlers' samurai-style topknots, is the alleged middleman in the gambling operation, according to the Japanese media. He couldn't be reached to comment.\n\nThe reports threaten to derail a grand tournament, something that hasn't happened since 1946, when repairs at a hall were delayed.\n\nThe Japan Sumo Association, which governs the sport and is known for its strict adherence to hierarchy and ritual, said it has formed a special investigation committee composed of 10 outsiders. The association will decide whether the Nagoya grand sumo tournament should be held as scheduled July 11, and if so, whether the 65 wrestlers who have admitted to gambling will be allowed to participate.\n\n\"We are making preparations to hold the Nagoya meet, but we will have another debate on the issue at an executive meeting on July 4, after we have received a report from the special investigative panel looking into illegal gambling,\" Goro Ishiyama, the chairman of the sumo association, on Monday.\n\nIn a move that underlines the level of obsession with the sport, national television channels featured former sumo wrestlers weighing in on the latest scandal on Monday evening, pushing aside the live news conference by the country's new prime minister, Naoto Kan.\n\nThe sumo association spokesman said 29 admitted to illegally betting on baseball. The rest gambled on cards, golf and mahjong, a Chinese tile game similar to cards.\n\nYuichi Sato, a spokesman for Japan's ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology\u2014which supervises the JSA\u2014said the government was particularly concerned about the reported ties to yakuza, which could further undermine the sport's public reputation.\n\n\"As a public entity, it is inappropriate for the sumo association to have links with the organized-crime groups, even if those are at the level of individual wrestlers,\" Mr. Sato said in a telephone interview.\n\nNagatanien Co., a company famous for its instant miso soup and mix for ochazuke, a green tea poured over rice, is the top corporate sponsor of the grand sumo tournaments. It said it would cancel its advertisements.\n\n\"We take this case seriously as it has a big social impact,\" the Tokyo-based company said in a statement on its website. \"We hope this traditional national sport will become clean.\"\n\nThe company, which started advertising at sumo matches a decade ago, spends 72 million yen a year, or about $794,000, on advertisements at the six grand sumo tournaments a year. McDonald's Japan, which started advertising at sumo tournaments last year on a smaller scale, said it currently had no plans to stop showing its banners at matches.\n\nSome sumo wrestlers, who were once considered to be near-deities in Japan and famed for their dignified\u2014and discreet\u2014manners, have been vilified over the past year for engaging in activities that reveal they are human after all: they drink, smoke and gamble, like other young men their age.\n\nIn February, Asashoryu, the 29-year-old former Mongolian grand champion, announced tearfully that he would retire from the sport following a drunken brawl on a Tokyo street. He had just won his 25th national tournament in January. The JSA has also been plagued by the arrests of marijuana-smoking wrestlers and the hazing death of a trainee at one of Japan's stables, or sumo training centers, in 2008. Some wrestlers retired amid the allegations.\n\nThe moves come at a time when sumo in Japan has lost popularity to other sports such as soccer and baseball.\n\nFewer Japanese men find the sport alluring and the top ranks have been populated by foreigners\u2014primarily Eastern Europeans and Mongolians. The last time a native Japanese wrestler won a sumo tournament was in 2006.\n\nMiho Inada contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Mariko Sanchanta at mariko.sanchanta@wsj.com"}, {"annotators_ids": [15, 5, 14, 6, 10, 12, 16, 18, 4, 13], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Kerry, Lavrov start meeting on us military cooperation with Russia in Syria.\nKerry: Russia, U.S. have ability to make a difference.\nKerry, Lavrov show solidarity at French embassy.", "text": "MOSCOW\u2014At the start of a second day of discussions on a U.S. proposal for closer military cooperation with Russia in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the attack in Nice to emphasize the urgency of bringing about an end to the crisis in Syria.\n\n\"Nowhere is there a greater hotbed or incubator for these terrorists than in Syria,\" Mr. Kerry said Friday, at the top of a meeting with his Russian counterpart Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. \"People all over the world are looking to us and waiting for us to find a faster and more tangible way of them feeling that everything that is possible is being done to end this terrorist scourge.\" Mr. Lavrov began the meeting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attack in Nice that killed dozens late Thursday.\n\nHe said the attacks in Nice made the dialogue with the U.S. \"even more urgent and relevant\" and said the discussions Thursday night with Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow for \"an intensification of efforts to find a solution to the crisis and boosting efforts for more effective work,\" according to Interfax news agency.\n\nAt the start of the meetings Friday it was unclear if the U.S. and Russia would agree on a deal to increase military cooperation in Syria in exchange for Russia using its influence to ground Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's air force.\n\nMr. Kerry described three hours of meetings with Mr. Putin on Thursday evening as \"extremely frank and serious.\"\n\nIn what seemed to be a bid to urge Mr. Lavrov to take advantage of the deal Mr. Kerry had presented him, Mr. Kerry said Russia and the U.S. \"have the ability uniquely here to be able to make a difference.\"\n\nHe added: \"Making that difference can also have an effect on the bilateral relationship in ways that I think you both and I would like to see some progress.\"\n\nMr. Kerry is hoping that the U.S. proposal for closer military cooperation, which Russia has long wanted, will be a carrot that will encourage Russia to ground Syria's air force and help bring about an end to bombing of civilians, an important goal for the Obama administration.\n\nMr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov visited the French embassy in Moscow together on Friday afternoon in a show of solidarity with the victims of the truck attack in Nice that killed more than 80 people.\n\n\u200bThe officials took a break in their meetings on the Syria crisis to \u200bride together in the same motorcade to the embassy for a brief and somber proceeding.

A better immediate outcome to Egypt's three-week crisis is hard to imagine. Now comes the morning after, and the beginning of another drama for the Arab world's leading nation.\n\nThe collapse of the Mubarak regime, wholly unexpected a month ago, offers an overdue opportunity to let Egypt and fellow Arab states catch the global democracy wave that began in 1989. The way to a truly liberal democracy is long and filled with many potential wrong turns. But Egypt starts on it with an enthusiastic mandate for reform, and advantages as well as handicaps. ***\n\nAmong the advantages, the military council that says it will oversee a transition has had its reputation and popular support enhanced by the uprising. By most appearances, the brass pushed Mr. Mubarak out yesterday, after the Egyptian leader refused to step down in a greatly anticipated speech on Thursday night. He enraged the streets and jeopardized the army's position of neutrality, increasing the chances of violence.\n\nDictators of long standing rarely leave easily, or quickly, and at least Mr. Mubarak left before more blood was shed. His consiglieri, an ashen-faced Vice President Omar Suleiman, read a 30-second statement to announce Mr. Mubarak's departure and the transfer of power to the Supreme Council of the Armed Services. Mr. Suleiman, who was previously expected to take over, may be left out of the transition, too tarnished by the events of the past three weeks to play an effective leadership role.\n\nThe military has been the power behind the Egyptian throne since the 1952 coup, and skeptics called yesterday's power shift another military coup. Many other Third World countries have seen generals take over and promise a transition to democracy, only to stay for good. The military has interests that run deep into Egypt's politics and economy, and the generals will want those safeguarded. But the circumstances of this \"coup\" are unique. The military yesterday promised to honor the people's demands for democracy. The last month was also a good lesson for them that in this century free societies tend to be more stable.\n\nField Marshal Mohamed Tantawi, who was Egypt's defense minister, and the other senior officers on the military council can take some obvious steps to build their legitimacy. As soon as possible they should lift emergency rule, which has been enforced since Anwar Sadat's assassination in 1981 and Mr. Mubarak's rise to the throne.\n\nBy rising up in January, Egyptians claimed their right to free speech and assembly. Such habits of a free society are worth decriminalizing and promoting. Long stifled by Mr. Mubarak's tight grip, the country hasn't had time to debate and disagree, nurture opposition figures and join political parties.\n\nThis transition will take time, a reality acknowledged by many in Cairo's Tahrir Square. The demonstrations were all the more remarkable for throwing up no leader in the mold of a Lech Walesa. Speaking on al Jazeera last night, former U.N. official Mohamed ElBaradei talked about \"a one-year transition\" to free elections. Before those take place, he said that Egypt needs a new constitution drawn up by a provisional council, including figures from the military and opposition. Ayman Nour, an opposition leader jailed by the Mubarak regime, said that Egyptians waited for yesterday for many years and would be patient. This is wise counsel.\n\nWho knows what leader might emerge. Mr. ElBaradei lived abroad until the revolution started, and Mr. Nour's party lacks deep support and is divided. Marshal Tantawi won good will by appearing on Tahrir Square during the protests.\n\nBut the most galvanizing figure of the uprising is the Google executive, Wael Ghonim, who was jailed for a time but emerged with the Nelson Mandela-like message that he sought no revenge against his captors. This, too, is wisdom, because in history's successful revolutions victors have sought reconciliation rather than reprisals. Think the Philippines and South Africa, not France or Iran.\n\nTo satisfy the aspirations of this revolution, the political reforms will have to be credible and deep, not merely cosmetic. A Mubarak in new clothing will invite more trouble down the road. A democracy with proper constitutional checks, competing branches of government and the rule of law offers the best insurance against the rise of a different form of autocracy led by the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe Brotherhood is disciplined and organized and will no doubt fight to gain power. But it's worth noting that the words heard most often from protestors in Egypt have been \"dignity,\" \"modernity,\" \"freedom,\" \"jobs.\" We shouldn't overlook that at this moment the hallmarks of successful societies\u2014democracy and a vibrant free market\u2014appear to have displaced Allah as the galvanizing ideas for the young in Egypt and Tunisia.\n\nPolitical Islam is so 1979\u2014nowhere more so than in Iran, where an opposition rose up two years ago with the same demands as the Egyptians, only to fail amid a ruthless and violent government crackdown. (See editorial below.) Egypt's revolt should inspire the Iranians anew, and it will if it ends in greater freedom.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe can't dictate events in Egypt, but they can influence this transition. America's close ties and $1.5 billion in yearly aid to the military, which has been armed by Washington since the 1979 Camp David accords, will give the U.S. influence with the generals. Another carrot to Egypt's next leaders would be a free trade agreement and open access to the U.S. and EU markets for its goods as democracy advances.\n\n***\n\nPresident Obama spoke for many Americans yesterday by saying that Egypt's nonviolent revolution \"inspired us\" with \"a moral force that bent the arc of history toward justice.\" He has learned since his embarrassing silence over Iran in 2009. But this is also a day to note that George W. Bush was the President who broke with the foreign policy establishment and declared that Arabs deserved political freedom as much as the rest of the world. He was reviled for it by many of the same pundits who are now claiming solidarity with Egyptians in the streets. We are all neocons now.\n\nEgypt's march toward political freedom is only beginning, and we can expect more drama and disagreement as it unfolds. But this new Egypt is the best opportunity since 9/11 to change the sclerotic Arab world, and it ought to be seized by Egyptians and their friends."}, {"annotators_ids": [10, 4, 15, 5, 14, 16, 6, 12, 13, 18], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "Man charged with threatening ricin-laced letters to kill Judge.\nFBI trying to find source of ricin letters.\nAnother letter containing ricin was directed to Spokane Post Office.", "text": "(CNN) -- A 37-year-old man arrested Wednesday in Washington state as part of an investigation of ricin-laced letters threatened in one such letter to injure and kill a federal judge, a grand jury indictment alleges.\n\nFBI agents arrested Matthew Ryan Buquet on Wednesday afternoon, and he made his initial court appearance in Spokane later in the day, the federal agency's Washington state office said in a news release.\n\nBuquet remained in custody after the appearance, and he'll stay behind bars at least until a bail hearing takes place next Tuesday afternoon, FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich said.\n\nA grand jury charged Buquet with mailing threatening communication, claiming he \"knowingly and willfully\" mailed through the U.S. Postal Service a letter \"containing a threat to injure and kill Judge (Fred) Van Sickle,\" according to the indictment.\n\nVan Sickle is a senior judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington.\n\nIn a subsequent news release, the FBI said tests -- conducted by that agency and the Spokane Regional Health District -- showed that a suspicious substance found with the letter was \"active ricin toxin.\"\n\n\"Our coordinated team acted swiftly to resolve a potentially dangerous situation, and continues working tirelessly around the clock to investigate the origin of the letters and to address any remaining, potential risks,\" said Laura Laughlin, the FBI's special-agent-in-charge at the bureau's Seattle office.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has been trying to find the source of the two letters containing ricin since they were intercepted in a screening procedure at a postal facility in Spokane, the FBI said last week.\n\nThe American Postal Workers Union earlier did say a ricin-laced letter was sent to a judge in Spokane, the northeastern Washington city in which Van Sickle works.\n\nAnother letter reportedly containing the toxin was directed to the Spokane Post Office, the union said.

Both those things must absolutely change.\"\n\nThe FDA argues it did not come to its decision lightly, saying it conducted a \"thorough and careful analysis of extensive scientific literature, review of hundreds of public comments on the issue, and several public meetings\" in an effort to ensure that future drugs are \"properly prescribed and appropriately used by the patients who need them most.\"\n\nThe FDA's proposal is scheduled to be submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services by early December, but the DEA has the final decision on whether to reclassify the drugs. A spokesman for the DEA told CNN it would be premature to speak about the FDA's recommendation at this time.\n\nIn September, the FDA took another step to reduce painkiller abuse with new labeling regulations, which are set to go into effect at the end of this year. Currently, the labels on the drugs say they are for \"the relief of moderate to severe pain in patients requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid treatment for an extended period of time.\" The new labels will say the drugs should be used only when \"alternative treatment options are inadequate.\"\n\nThe FDA said it hopes the changes will result in a larger conversation about pain management between patients and doctors."}, {"annotators_ids": [16, 4, 10, 13, 15, 5, 6, 14, 18, 12], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Bizarre feud over rubbish between men captured on camera.\nPete Sykes and postmen clash over rubbish.\nVIDEO: Now watch the battle of the bin bags.", "text": "By \nLucy Crossley\n\nPUBLISHED:\n\n12:15 EST, 19 January 2013\n\n\n| \n\nUPDATED:\n\n12:59 EST, 19 January 2013\n\nA bizarre neighbourly feud between two men over a pile of rubbish has been captured on camera and viewed by thousands of internet users.\n\nA passing postman filmed the warring neighbours in action as they each carried bin bags to opposite sides of the road, without uttering a word to each other.\n\nThe battle was thought to have sparked because neither of the two men had wanted the filled bags to be outside their homes, and so decided to move the rubbish to the other side of the street.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nBizarre: A neighbourly feud between two men over a pile of rubbish has been captured on camera\n\nClash: The two men were caught on camera hauling rubbish from one side of a street to the other following a dispute over the bin bags\n\nHowever, both of their attempts to \nhaul the rubbish away from their houses proved futile, as the other man \nwould simply return it to where it had started.\n\nIn\nthe short clip, filmed by postman Pete Sykes, the two men, one dressed \nin jeans and a black jacket, and the other in a brown coat and woolly \nhat, can be seen silently criss-crossing across the street armed with \npurple bin bags.\n\nMeanwhile Mr Sykes and his fellow postmen can be heard chuckling hysterically as they watched the drama unfold.\n\nMr Sykes, a former footballer with Dover Athletic dubbed the battle 'rubbish tennis', after he filmed the dispute in Granville Street, Dover, Kent.\n\nStand-off: The battle was thought to have sparked because neither of the two men had wanted the filled bags to be outside their homes\n\nFutile: In the clip one man could be seen taking rubbish across the road, only for his neighbour to return it\n\nIn the footage Mr Sykes can be heard to say 'There are two guys here arguing over what rubbish should be on what side of the road.\n\n'Should it be outside his house, or should it be outside my house?

In the past month, the state has announced initiatives to ease the impact on consumers, including automatically enrolling Health Republic members in other plans.\n\nBut New York's physicians and hospitals say the shutdown has left them, too, in a lurch.\n\nThe trade organization Greater New York Hospital Association said Health Republic owes hospitals statewide more than $165 million.\n\nThe Medical Society of the State of New York, a physician's association, said of 800 doctors surveyed, 43% have claims unpaid by the insurer. Of these, 18% said they were owed $25,000 or more.\n\nThe problem particularly affects providers in New York City, Westchester County and on Long Island, where most Health Republic customers lived. Suffolk County alone had 43,703 Health Republic members, or 21% of the co-op's membership, according to the insurer's regulatory filings.\n\nHealth Republic referred all questions to the state's Department of Financial Services. A department spokesman said a financial review was ongoing, and payments to providers would depend on the review's results. \u201cWe're working to conserve assets and maximize the amount of claims the company can pay,\" he added.\n\nA quirk of state law has compounded the problem. All states have so-called guaranty associations, which function as safety nets if an insurer falls into insolvency.\n\nThat meant that when regulators shut down CoOportunity Health, a co-op in Iowa and Nebraska, those states' guaranty associations covered more than $110 million in unpaid claims of hospitals and physicians, said a spokesman for the trade group National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations.\n\nIn some states, however, the health insurance co-ops weren't licensed as health-insurance companies, and therefore not covered.\n\nNew York is the only state where the guaranty association doesn't cover claims of health-insurance companies. But it does cover health-insurance claims if policies are sold by a life-insurance company.\n\n\u201cWith the onset of the exchanges, and growth in individual health insurance market, in retrospect this lack of guaranty program for health insurance sold by health insurance companies certainly seems to be a tremendous gap in the safety net,\" said Scott Harrington, a professor of health-care management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nThe hospital association is lobbying state government for a guaranty fund\u2014with money from insurers\u2014to protect hospitals in the future, said Kenneth Raske, the organization's president. \u201cIt would be a travesty of justice if the hospitals were ultimately denied payment,\" he said.\n\nThe New York Health Plan Association, a trade group of health insurers, responded that the hospitals \u201care worried about their own wallets\" and suggested using state funds to pay the Health Republic claims.\n\nFurther complicating Health Republic's woes is that its claims were processed by MagnaCare, the provider network rented by the insurer. The network stopped processing claims in early November.\n\nThat MagnaCare was able to withdraw from its role is particularly frustrating, said Charles Rothberg, an ophthalmologist in Patchogue, N.Y., on Long Island.\n\n\u201cI feel like a chump that all the other business partners involved in these transactions can walk away and protect their business interests,\" Dr. Rothberg said. \u201cAs a doctor, I think I have an obligation to continue caring for a patient.\n\n\u201cThey aren't going to process the claims, so what hope do I have of getting paid at all?\" he added.\n\nAsked for comment, MagnaCare said \u201cclaim processing and provider payment are solely the responsibility of Health Republic.\"\n\nPhysicians say the problem isn't solely financial.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a disaster like this, it makes physicians very leery in engaging in other health-care reform initiatives that carry similar risks, when the state or feds are unwilling to back the physicians,\" said Dr. Joseph Maldonado, a urologist who is president of the Medical Society of the State of New York.\n\nThe most vulnerable are private-practice physicians, Dr. Maldonado said. \u201cFor those groups,\" he added, \"the question is: \u2018When the next Health Republic comes on the market, do we sign up with them?' \"\n\nWrite to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com"}, {"annotators_ids": [10, 12, 13, 16, 6, 14, 18, 5, 4], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], "summary": "Americans ' human compassion ' binds us one to the other '.\nSyrian refugees face miserable winter in Lebanon.\nBut today we are fast-forwarding.\nThe U.S. is the largest humanitarian donor to Syria.\nMandela - \"those most vulnerable are not invisible, ignored\".", "text": "(CNN) -- America has endured the exhaustion of a decade of war and the insult of a battered economy. Now many Americans reject all foreign entanglements as expensive, fruitless and, ultimately, futile.\n\nIn a recent Pew Research poll, 80% of those answering agreed with the statement, \"We should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems and building up our strength and prosperity here at home.\"\n\nFor the first time since Pew began asking the question in 1964, more than half said they believed \"the U.S. should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.\" In the past that figure has topped out around 40%.\n\nYet even as Americans work to draw the blinds along the nation's borders, the country celebrates the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela, a leader who looked relentlessly outward.\n\n\"Our human compassion binds us the one to the other,\" Mandela is quoted as saying, \"not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learned how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future.\"\n\nAnd right now that common suffering is found in abundance in Syria. In 2\u00c2\u00bd years the conflict has gone from local uprising to sprawling and brutal civil war. The U.S. announced Wednesday it was suspending even nonlethal aid to fighters in northern Syria opposed to the Assad regime as moderates among them lose ground to forces aligned with al-Qaeda.\n\nAn estimated 125,000 Syrians have died in the conflict -- the equivalent of killing the population of Cambridge, Massachusetts, or Burbank, California. The war has made refugees of 2 million Syrians. More than a million of these refugees are children, and three-quarters of them are under the age of 12. Polio has returned to attack Syrians, most of whom haven't even reached their second birthday.\n\nCities are said to face starvation, with families said to be turning to eating dogs and anything else that might keep them alive. Winter is nearing and humanitarian agencies are hurrying to ready supplies for the millions of refugees, many of whom fled with only the barest of belongings. As of September, 100,000 Syrian children in Jordan were not in school and the United Nations predicts double that number in Lebanon before year's ends. Water and working toilets are scarce.\n\nNews: Syrian refugees face miserable winter in Lebanon\n\nThe human suffering, in short, is great. But today we are fast-forwarding through these sad stories, keeping our eyes shut and our wallets closed. The charity Mercy Corps raised more funds for the victims of the typhoon in the Philippines in three days than it has in almost three years for the war in Syria. But few have taken to the streets or to Capitol Hill to say that the United States should do more. In fact, the feeling seems to be that the U.S. is doing quite enough.\n\nAlready the country is the largest humanitarian donor to Syria. President Barack Obama ran into resistance at even the prospect of armed intervention when he tried to push for \"limited\" military action earlier this year -- an effort that ended with a deal to collect Syria's chemical weapons. But he made no progress in creating a humanitarian corridor or imposing a ceasefire to help ease the suffering of those trapped amid falling rockets and flying bullets.\n\nJuxtapose this against this past week, when the world has lauded a leader who showed through his actions and his words that human compassion and a shared humanity sat at the very center of the human experience. Mandela pushed us to care about others, to see ourselves in others, especially when circumstances conspired to rob them of their homes, their livelihoods and their dignity.\n\nIndeed, as Obama said at Tuesday's memorial service, \"Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa -- Ubuntu -- a word that captures Mandela's greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us.\"\n\nCertainly helping is complicated, but standing by as more children die and humanitarian catastrophe sweeps the country is a comfortless option. America is tired, but avoiding the world is not a strategy, it is a preference. It will not leave America safer or stronger.\n\nDiplomatic energy dedicated to opening a humanitarian corridor is critical. Former Ambassador Thomas Pickering is among many diplomats who have advanced the idea that America can do more. If the United States can devote days of urgent and focused diplomacy to getting Syria's chemical weapons in safer hands, surely we can try harder -- in concert with key players and powers -- to do the same for Syria's children. And Americans, for their part, can give to organizations that help parents get blankets and water. And helping teenagers to deal with the traumas they have witnessed can ease some of their suffering.\n\nThe world celebrates the life of a stoic hero who dared to stand up to injustice -- a man who would not live quietly beneath the easy shade of comfort, but who acted when he saw others suffer as oppression flourished. But we must heed his words as well -- a call to engage with the world, to ensure that those most vulnerable are not invisible, ignored.\n\n\"What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived,\" Mandela said. \"It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.\"\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gayle Tzemach Lemmon."}, {"annotators_ids": [10, 5, 12, 13, 16, 6, 14, 4], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], "summary": "Fort Hood vet with PTSD undergoing treatments.\nPTSD rates in service members at 15% to 20%.\nThirty percent of vets diagnosed with PTSD.\nWhat causes PTSD and How to make it more likely.\n5.

What is PSTD?\n\nIt's natural to experience fear in dangerous situations. But people with PTSD may behave as though they are under attack when there is no real imminent threat.\n\nA person who suffers PTSD typically re-experiences the trauma through flashbacks and nightmares, experiences that can seem as real as the actual trauma. The person often feels intensely that the trauma could happen again at any time.\n\nThoughts and feelings can trigger symptoms, but so can words, situations or objects that remind the person of a traumatic situation.\n\nNational Institutes of Health: PTSD\n\n2. How common is it?\n\nAnyone who has experienced a life-threatening situation can develop PTSD, according to Dr. Stephen J. Cozza, a professor of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.\n\nAlthough over the course of a lifetime, many people have extremely distressing or threatening experiences, only a small percentage will experience PTSD, experts say. The range of responses is largely based on the amount of exposure to the stressor, said Cozza. Most studies examining the rate of PTSD in service members put the rates at about 15% to 20%.\n\nThirty percent of service members who have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan have been diagnosed with PTSD, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs study.\n\nThe nonprofit think-tank RAND Corporation estimates a third of veterans likely have some type of traumatic brain injury, PTSD or depression, which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000.\n\n\"We need to remember that while substantial numbers of vets have mental health conditions,\" the majority do not, Cozza said.\n\n\"We don't want to stigmatize our vets, because many of them are not ill,\" he said. \"As an organization and as a community, the military has varying levels of health and risk. There are more services for mental health care in the military than there has ever been before.\"\n\nWhat is war's true toll? The Uncounted\n\n3. What causes PTSD?\n\nExperiencing any kind of trauma or dangerous event -- including seeing people harmed or killed or personally getting injured -- raises the risk for PTSD. A history of mental illness also makes PTSD more likely, as does a lack of social support after a traumatic event and enduring additional stress in its aftermath.\n\nScientists are looking at the role of genes that are involved in the creation of fear memories. There are also neuroscientists investigating brain differences in people who have PTSD.\n\nGenes and brain structural differences may raise a person's risk for the condition without causing symptoms, according to the National Institutes of Health. The early growth of the brain may be affected by environmental factors or a history of mental illness.\n\n3. Do other mental illnesses make it worse?\n\nOther problems such as depression and insomnia that a veteran may have had before deployment are magnified with PTSD, Lyles said.\n\n\"It does not help itself,\" he said. \"It's kind of like a pinball that gets trapped inside a machine that can't get out and just continues to ping around. You try to live your life as normal as possible but it's always present.\"\n\n4. How is it diagnosed in the military?\n\nA typical PTSD screening would be a well-structured diagnostic interview, and a few other tests, lasting about two hours, said Michael Telch, psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nDuring the debriefing process from the U.S. military, returning soldiers go through an interview and other evaluations that may indicate PTSD, Lyles said. If there is reason to suspect PTSD, the veteran then goes for a full medical evaluation that involves PTSD testing.\n\nThere is generally not a big lag time to make a medical diagnosis after the two-hour interview, Telch said.\n\nHowever, it can take months before the diagnosis is officially recognized by the military, Lyles said.\n\nMany cases of PTSD go undetected because some view the condition as a sign of weakness. Some also don't want to go through the extra battery of tests when they return home, he said.\n\n\"Many of these individuals fall through the cracks,\" Lyles said.\n\n5. Do people with PTSD pose an increased risk of violence to themselves or others?\n\nHaving PTSD does not mean that a person will be violent. But certain sounds, images and smells can trigger alarming memories to a person with the condition, and they react as if they were in the midst of war.\n\n\"Reality becomes skewed because you've been trained to be violent,\" Lyles said. \"So it's really hard to shut that out.\"\n\nPTSD is not only about fear and anxiety. Patients may experience other kinds of emotional disturbances, and violence may be a way that they respond.\n\n\"Coping with strong feelings of anger, shame or guilt can be played out in terms of violent behavior,\" Telch said.\n\nIraq and Afghanistan veterans who struggle with anger are twice as likely as other vets to be arrested for crimes, according to the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, which published a study last year.\n\nThe study, conducted by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine, examined 1,388 combat veterans. Researchers found that about 23% of those with PTSD and high irritability had been arrested for criminal offenses.\n\nBut researchers also found that other factors unrelated to military service -- including growing up around violence or drug abuse -- were factors behind why some vets committed crimes.\n\n6. Does this impact veterans' performance in the workplace, after they leave the service?\n\nEmployers sometimes cite PTSD as a reason for not hiring veterans, because of public misunderstanding, former President George W. Bush said in February at the George W. Bush Library Military Service Initiative. The condition, he said, is mislabeled as a \"disorder.\"\n\n\"Employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure, and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress,\" Bush said.\n\nA person who has been successful in treatment should be able to function in the workplace, Telch said. But without treatment, symptoms can be severe, and impair functioning at work, in social situations and in the family.\n\n8. How do people with PTSD come back to normal?\n\nExposure therapy often helps the person with PTSD revisit or re-experience their trauma as a means of lessening the effect the memory has on them, said Dr. Albert \"Skip\" Rizzo, a psychiatrist who works with the military and has pioneered use of virtual reality for treating PTSD.\n\nThis kind of therapy has been around for years. Typically a therapist would ask someone to imagine they are experiencing their trauma again. This would happen repeatedly, and ideally, with each retelling of what happened, the event would seem gradually less threatening.\n\nRizzo, who is with the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, and other experts have employed virtual reality for this purpose. Patients wear goggles and describe their experiences while a technician stands by with a console changing the scene to fit the patient's description.\n\nIf the patient recalls hearing a young boy's voice, for instance, the technician makes that happen. If the patient experienced the trauma at night or in the daytime, or perhaps was involved in an IED explosion, those circumstances will be created in the virtual world.\n\n\"We can begin to pace the exposure in a very evocative fashion,\" Rizzo said.\n\n\"This works because some people don't engage in the trauma memory at a sufficient level. They don't engage fully with their imagination to confront difficult memories.\"\n\nA therapy that uses similar principles is called cognitive processing therapy. It helps patients become aware of their thoughts and feelings and learn how to deal with changes in beliefs from before and after trauma.\n\nSome patients also benefit from medication.\n\n9. What resources are available to help service members, veterans and families?\n\nEveryone in the family of a service member with PTSD needs to be involved in the treatment plan, Lyles said.\n\nThe U.S. Army Medical Department has a variety of resources on its website. These include the Real Warriors Campaign, which helps service members overcome stigma surrounding mental health treatment, and Army One Source, which helps people locate support services.\n\nIf you

Correctional authorities will sometimes let inmates make fundamental decisions, such as whether to sell the firm, but prisoners can't oversee day-to-day operations. Nor can they try to expand their companies from a prison cell. If you become an involuntary guest of the government, someone else has to run the show while you're gone.\n\nThis arrangement isn't much different from what Donald Trump announced he would do as president. Speaking at a press conference in January, he said his eldest sons would control his business empire through a trust. Critics of the Trump plan say that ethical questions remain, since Mr. Trump still owns the company. Yet this just might be the best a successful businessman can do\u2014for himself, and more important, for the country. Conventional wisdom suggests Mr. Trump's ownership of businesses creates conflicts of interest that can be solved only by selling the businesses or transferring them to a truly blind trust.\n\nAn outright sale of Mr. Trump's businesses sounds good, but imagine what it would look like in practice. Selling any business is much harder than putting a house or a used car on the market. Mr. Trump's businesses would be especially difficult to sell given their complexity and geographic dispersion.\n\nAny sale process starts with lawyers and brokers, who get their arms around the asset\u2014figure out what's being sold\u2014and assemble information for possible buyers. Then brokers reach out to the market and try to find the best potential buyers for each asset. Buyers kick tires, ask questions, investigate, make offers, negotiate a possible acquisition. All of this becomes even more complicated when the seller also happens to lead the free world.\n\nAfter buyer and seller agree on price, contract negotiations and closing preparations take months. Any sale of joint venture interests or valuable contracts needs third-party consent\u2014dragging out the process even longer. Some assets, like hotel-licensing contracts, would require Mr. Trump or his family to provide services and expertise that a purchaser might not be able to provide.\n\nLenders would have to consent to each sale or, more likely, get repaid with new financing arranged by the buyer. Another burden: Outgoing lenders often charge for getting prepaid, because they expected and wanted their money to earn interest at an attractive rate longer than it did. If a sale involves multiple assets or even an initial public offering, this creates more complexities, though as a whole it may entail less work than selling every asset separately. Mr. Trump's four-year term could be halfway over before all his businesses were sold.\n\nSo why not transfer all of Mr. Trump's assets to a truly blind trust run by an independent board, not his sons? As a practical matter, it's impossible. The Trump Organization is not a stock portfolio. It requires at least some involvement and oversight by the guy who created it.\n\nDivestiture or a blind trust can unnecessarily destroy value. It could convert Mr. Trump's businesses into a portfolio of assets that are probably not real estate, hotel licensing rights, casinos, and consumer products\u2014the asset types that he knows best. Over time they may perform nowhere near as well as his existing portfolio.\n\nBut why should he care about his business anymore? This goes beyond Mr. Trump. Political outsiders have an attitude very different from those who have made a career in politics. Their fresh perspective can lead to innovative policy. If people succeed in the private economy but must sell a complex business empire or turn it over to potentially incompetent trustees, many qualified and competent Americans might shun public service.\n\nPeople shouldn't have to destroy their businesses to hold office, just as they also shouldn't operate and actively participate in a business. Instead, the commander in chief must have people he trusts managing and operating his business interests for him on a day-to-day basis, as Mr. Trump apparently does. If this system is strict enough for a federal prisoner, it's also acceptable for the president.\n\nIf Mr. Trump's business reaches a critical fork in the road\u2014a major sale or repositioning of an asset\u2014maybe he can make a decision. Otherwise, he should focus on his day job.\n\nMr. Stein is the principal of Joshua Stein PLLC, a commercial real-estate law firm in New York."}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 6, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 4, 12, 14], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "British adventure explorer Sarah Outen to row North Pacific solo.\nTeenage round the world sailor Outen takes on A racing challenge.\nOuten's Pacific crossing.", "text": "London, England (CNN) -- Rowing across the North Pacific Ocean may hardly seem comparable to achieving success in the humdrum daily grind of an office desk job.\n\nFor British adventure explorer Sarah Outen however, the gratification of completing a task of great importance to the self, is the same no matter the context or environment.\n\n\"It's so satisfying if you accomplish something that's a challenge to you,\" said the 26-year-old who last week set off on her quest to become the first woman to row the North Pacific solo.\n\n\"Whether you're in the water, or in an office, that's universal,\" she adds.\n\nOuten is undertaking the 4,500 nautical mile challenge from the east coast of Japan to the west coast of Canada, as part of a larger voyage that will see her circumnavigate the globe without the aid of any mechanical engines.\n\nShe started in London in April 2011 and has so far made it 11,000 miles to Japan, biking and kayaking through Europe, Russia and China along the way.\n\nSee also: Around the world on two boats and a bike\n\nThe epic journey will eventually see Outen return to London and after navigating the North Pacific, she plans to traverse North America by bike.\n\nA further solo ocean crossing -- this time the Atlantic Ocean -- will follow before she paddles back to her port of origin in the UK capital.\n\n\"I love the challenge,\" says Outen of the gargantuan adventure that will take her fully two and a half years to complete.\n\n\"I rowed across the Indian Ocean in 2009 and it was then that I thought up this journey (the London to London trip).

So this latest report took the study to the next step, seeing if the experiments translated to the success level of real CEOs.\n\n\"It appears that the labor market is matching deeper-voiced individuals with larger firms, which means this is influencing boards of directors' judgments, perhaps,\" said William Mayew, associate professor at Fuqua, who headed the study.\n\nBut Mayew says researchers still need to figure out why this matching is happening for it to have meaningful applications.\n\n\"What we don't know yet is where the benefit comes from. Does it come from cutting through red tape in a big corporation a bit faster if you're more authoritative or dominant vocally?\" he said.\n\nRead more: Bullying bosses dominate their way to power\n\nVoice pitch could also be related to other physical characteristics that suggest dominance, such as how tall you are, how big you are, what your facial structure is -- and it is still unclear if other factors like these are the true influencers of becoming a high-earning CEO.\n\nWhile research like this may imply that aspiring leaders who are short and have a high voice pitch are genetically disadvantaged, Mayew says this view places too much weight on a few physical traits.\n\n\"It takes a lot of different features that come together in order to make a person who he or she is, and I think it'd be premature to suggest that if you had a high-pitched voice or if you were short that you just have no shot of ascending to leadership ranks. There's much more to it,\" he says.\n\nWhile Mayew acknowledges there are ways for CEOs to change how to speak, such as through presentation training, he is skeptical about the usefulness of speaking in an unnatural way or dressing a certain way to make up for physical disadvantages.

Using fewer words, and omitting complaints or explanations are other ways to convey power.\n\n\"Women tend to give their power away when they 'chat,' go on and on endlessly,\" Starr says.\n\nStarr says to look successful in the workplace, executives should dress in one color, which adds height, and wear plain fabric rather than patterned styles. Women should maintain a consistent business look and avoid open-toe sandals, bare legs and dangling or sparkling jewelry in the workplace. \"Trust is higher when an elegant, sophisticated business look is consistently presented,\" she says.\n\nRead more: Why we pick bad leaders\n\nWhen one of her male clients moved into an executive role, she says, she suggested that he stop wearing short-sleeved shirts, because it is a \"blue-collar look.\"\n\nStarr also advises against dressing down on the weekends or when traveling.

Now she's the chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial-investment firm for women.\n\nFor years, Ms. Krawcheck says she thought the idea of a woman-focused investment firm was a bad idea that would lead to \"remedial financial education.\" But over time, she came to see that women are motivated differently from men, and that the industry is focused far more on the way men view investing.\n\n\"Women are not as energized by outperforming the market or picking the latest stock or getting that latest money manager and talking about it at cocktail parties as gentlemen are,\" she says. \"Women are more about, 'I want to reach my goals. What I'm really interested in is can I retire well, not whether I'm going to outperform when the euro is weak versus the yen.' \"\n\nShe says she'd like to think that co-founding Ellevest will prove to be the best investment she has ever made. But meanwhile, here's a look at what she says are the best and worst investments in her rearview mirror.\n\nBest Bet A house in the Hamptons\n\nINVESTMENT: $9.5 million of cashed-out Citigroup stock\n\nGAINS: Around $7.5 million in unrealized real-estate value\n\nIn 2004, when Ms. Krawcheck was Citigroup's chief financial officer, she wanted to buy a vacation home in the Hamptons, the famed stretch of exclusive beach communities along Long Island's south shore. She zeroed in on a house in Quogue. To make the purchase, she decided to cash out $9.5 million of her Citigroup stock. That was something of a faux pas in the C-suite.\n\n\"It was really frowned upon at Citigroup to sell stock as a senior leader,\" she says. \"We had an informal-that-was-sort-of-formal blood oath where you didn't sell stock.\"\n\nShe did it anyway. She cashed out when Citi was around $40 a share. Today the stock is at the equivalent of about $7.50, after adjusting for a 1-for-10 reverse share split in 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, the house in Quogue was recently appraised at $17 million.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY: \"The real takeaway, of course, is diversity, diversity, diversity,\" she says. \"I diversified away from Citigroup stock and into real estate.\"\n\nHer portfolio at the time wasn't nearly as diversified as it should have been, she says. Citigroup was her biggest asset \"by a good measure.\" Her financial adviser at the time said she could survive a hit to her Citi stock, but so much of her other assets were tied up in equities, too, leaving her far too exposed.\n\n\"Look,\" Ms. Krawcheck says, \"stocks are wonderful, bonds are fantastic, [but] a home is your heart,\" she says. \"I wanted that home for my children to have a place outside of the city to go every weekend and summers.\"\n\nWorst Bet\n\nBank of America\n\nINVESTMENT: $1 million\n\nLOSSES: About $500,000 and an incalculable amount of time, energy and lost wages\n\nIn 2009, Ms. Krawcheck was hired to lead Merrill Lynch Wealth Management eight months after the company was purchased by Bank of America. At the time, she says, she saw it as more than the opportunity to lead a storied financial institution. It was a chance to help dig the company, industry and country out of the financial crisis, \"and to really make some small part of history.\"\n\nTo show that she was committed, she bought $1 million of Bank of America stock.\n\n\"If I was going to work at the company, I wanted to be all in,\" she says.\n\n\"I wanted to be financially committed to it. I wanted to be emotionally committed to it. I wanted to have the [Merrill Lynch] bull on the hat.\"\n\nUnfortunately, she says, \"they weren't as committed to me as I was to them.\"\n\nIn 2011, Bank of America let her go as part of a reorganization. No longer with the company, she ditched the stock, which had fallen roughly 50%, from about $16 to near $8, and took a $500,000 loss.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Ms. Krawcheck says the sourness of the investment was about more than the loss of the stock value.

The chance, they said, to live a life without fear.\n\nSo they lined up Wednesday at lawyers' offices and immigration help centers to complete deferred deportation applications posted online the day before.\n\nThis was not amnesty or immunity. Nor was it a shortcut to citizenship or a permanent fix to their status: each was illegally in America.\n\nBut they had hope in their hearts they would be allowed to stay in the country they knew as their own. That they could emerge from the shadows.\n\nAna Laura, 20, and Juana Ramirez, 23, filled out their form at Atlanta attorney Charles Kuck's suburban office. Their parents brought them to the United States from the Mexican state of Michoacan many years ago. They were just toddlers. And they were without any documentation.\n\nFace of hope: Lining up to spend two more years in the U.S.\n\nThey finished high school in Chicago and moved to Georgia three years ago, where they get by working odd jobs here and there. They consider themselves U.S. citizens.\n\nOnly, they're not.\n\n\"I didn't have a choice to come here. I have done nothing bad here,\" Juana said.\n\nOn this day, when a bold new immigration policy change went into effect, the Ramirez sisters dared to dream and found themselves tempering their emotions.\n\n\"I'm scared to get my hopes up,\" Ana said.\n\nScared perhaps because there are no guarantees that come attached to President Barack Obama's executive order signed in June.\n\nIt allows undocumented immigrants under 30 who were brought to the United States as children to apply for a temporary deferral of deportation if they are in school or have finished school. It allows them to obtain work permits and gives them protection that they won't be deported in the next two years.\n\nAfter that, Obama would need to sign a new order, unless legislation known as the DREAM Act, which has similar provisions, is made into law by then. If Obama loses the November election, there is no guarantee that such a policy would be in place in two years, when all applicants have to renew.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service has assured prospective applicants that their information will remain confidential and will not be used to round up other undocumented family members.\n\nStill, the risks made some stop to wonder. David Hernandez, 17, was one.\n\nHe and his brother Daniel, 15, listened carefully to Kuck as he detailed the program.\n\nThe brothers arrived in the United States on tourist visas 15 years ago. Like the Ramirez sisters, they were toddlers -- David was 3 and Daniel just 1.\n\nTheir mother, Salima Hernandez, wanted education and a better future for her children. She said she didn't worry about their legal status until she learned that they would not be able to continue their education without a government-issued ID or Social Security number.\n\nDavid, now a senior in high school, and Daniel, a freshman, say they were not aware of their status until a couple of years ago, when they began to make plans for college.\n\n\"I felt that after high school I didn't have anywhere to go,\" David said. \"I felt that if it was not something coming up soon I would end up back in Mexico.\"\n\nRelief from deportation\n\nYes, he was concerned about revealing his status to federal authorities. They would know now who he was and how to find him.\n\nBut it was worth it.\n\n\"Whatever comes in the future is better than three months ago,\" he said.\n\nThe night before in Houston, thousands of people flocked to the consulates of Mexico and El Salvador to obtain passports and other identification documents from their home countries, CNN affiliate KHOU-TV reported.\n\nThe line wrapped around the building on 4506 Caroline Street, home of the Mexican consulate.\n\nNelly Hernanez said she'd been waiting a lifetime for this. What was a few hours more?\n\n\"I've been raised here since I was four, so I've been waiting for this day for a very long time. So it is worth it,\" she told KHOU.\n\nRoger Tamez wanted to finally get a driver's license, go back to school. Maybe play football.\n\nSo many dreams in that one line.\n\nThere were dreams, too, floating in the swelling crowd at the offices of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles.\n\nThe immigrant rights group expected about 1,000 people to show up Wednesday. It's estimated that just in the Los Angeles school district alone, 218,000 young immigrants are eligible to apply.\n\nObama's executive order brought thousands relief but many are painfully aware of their sharpest critics who say deferred deportations and the DREAM Act are a form of backdoor amnesty. What also cuts, they said, are charges that illegal immigrants will take jobs away from rightful Americans.\n\nEveryone has an opinion, said Martin Bustos, 23, who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 11.\n\nBut standing in line Wednesday, Bustos offered this thought: there were some jobs that most people don't want but immigrants are willing to take. And that immigrants work just as hard.\n\n\"We are like everyone else too,\" he said. \"We are human. We have families.\"\n\nIn New York, Antonio Alarcon, 17, just finished high school. He flipped through the form and spoke of how the six years he has been here has transformed. He feels much more American now than Mexican.\n\n\"I work hard. I pay taxes. I have a lot to contribute,\" he said.\n\nHe hoped his deportation deferment application would be processed quickly so he can see his parents again. They felt worn down by the economic downturn and the stress of their illegal status and finally went back to Mexico this year.\n\nThey were not there to see their son stand on a stage and graduate at the top of his class. Alarcon hoped that the next time he saw his mother and father, he would be enrolled in college.

A smudged shirt and dirt-covered pants hung from his wiry, 50-year-old frame.\n\nI was leaving the communal bathroom, having just plugged my drained cell phone into the outlet by the sink, when I saw him. He nodded warmly as we passed and I found myself suddenly wondering if I had just seen the last of my phone...\n\nWhen he saw me again, he said with incredible glee, \"Isn't this the most beautiful morning?\" I nodded and then went back into the bathroom to find my cell phone right where I left it. Needless to say, I felt more than a little guilty about being so judgmental.\n\nAnd that's how I met Ralph Benitez, the man who would eventually become the heart of my fatherhood documentary, \"The Evolution of Dad.\"\n\nA short time later, I was washing some silverware at the campground sink when Ralph appeared with his own dishes. As we scrubbed, he told me how his sons had brought him camping trip and how lucky he felt to be with them.\n\n\"You know, fatherhood saved my life. It did. I wouldn't be alive now if I hadn't become a dad,\" he confessed, explaining that before his three sons and one daughter were born, his life had been all about \"sex, drugs and rock-'n-roll.\"\n\nAs we finished the dishes, Ralph talked about his kids. He said one of his sons was gay and how, despite his cultural background, he accepted his son unconditionally. He told me about his 4-year-old granddaughter, for whom he was now a surrogate dad. I was startled and a little chastened. Here was this guy, who, minutes earlier, I had worried would steal my phone, and who I now realized completely personified everything that was noble about fatherhood.\n\nHe lived in the Bronx with his family, didn't have a computer and sometimes he didn't even have phone service. There was a great divide between this man from an inner city Latino community and me, a white Jewish guy from the affluent suburbs. But the differences in our backgrounds dissolved as we quickly forged a friendship.\n\nI visited Ralph and his family several times that summer, filming as much as I could of this dad who spoke for so many fathers. Witnessing Ralph with his granddaughter, Kayla, as he lovingly took her to the park or for a stroll to the corner deli, was inspiring. Kayla's biological father wasn't in the picture and Ralph had dutifully stepped into the role.\n\nAnd then there were the kids in the neighborhood who all looked up to him, many lacking dads of their own. Ralph called his two-bedroom apartment \"the safe house\" because, in this particularly tough area of the Bronx, it was a place that friends and family and neighborhood kids could come and always feel secure.\n\nFor Ralph, the world was a horn of plenty. \"You see?\" he would often say to his wife, \"If you have faith, God will provide.\" His wife Vilma, always the anchor to his exuberance, would roll her eyes with a \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" and although they occasionally squabbled, the love they shared with each other and everyone else in this safe haven was always tangible. If wealth could be only measured in love, then Bill Gates would've had nothing on Ralph.\n\nSadly, there was a sense of urgency to film Ralph as quickly as possible because his health was rapidly deteriorating -- Ralph had full-blown AIDS. Miraculously, he had managed to survive for more than 10 years with the virus because he had volunteered himself as a test subject for any of the experimental drugs that Sloan Kettering was trying. He was even among the first to take \"the cocktail.\" As we sat together in his driveway one day, he told me that the doctors had recently told him that his medicine was becoming increasingly less effective and there was nothing more to do.\n\nStill, we continued to spend time together and Ralph remained upbeat and hopeful. One of my best memories of Ralph occurred while taking a break from shooting, sitting with him in his driveway. In the heat radiating from the pavement, we ate plantains that Vilma had graciously cooked for us and talked about what was going on in the world, about our families, about anything. It was like we had known each other our whole lives.\n\nAs the summer slid away, so did Ralph's health. His family became less interested in being filmed, and Ralph explained that they were having a hard time coping with the fact that he wouldn't be around much longer.\n\nRalph Benitez passed away one snowy day in December 2008. Even though his passing wasn't a shock, it took a while for me to get over it. I'd never had a film subject die before, let alone a friend.\n\nRalph agreed to be in the film because he wanted to be remembered and because of how important he understood fatherhood to be in the lives of our kids.\n\nI wish he could've seen the finished film.

Gary Herbert said at a press conference that he felt \"surprised\" and \"disappointed\" that there was no \"finality\" on the issue of same-sex marriage. The state would comply with Monday's order, he said, and same-sex marriages would move forward.\n\n\"Regardless of your personal beliefs,\" he urged, \"... please treat each other with respect and with kindness as we transition through this new law.\"\n\nThe court's action does not mean there won't eventually be a final ruling on the constitutional questions -- many court observers fully expect a landmark decision in the next year or two -- but it does signal the justices are not ready to jump into the politically charged debate right now.\n\nThe high court's move surprised many observers. Advocates on both sides of the issue had wanted the court to offer a definitive, binding ruling on key constitutional questions.\n\n\"The question of whether same-sex marriage bans are constitutional is a historic issue, under the Constitution and for the Roberts Court,\" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a respected Washington attorney. \"It's hard to imagine a situation where judges are going to have more power to define the social and family relationships of the country.\" He's referring to Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nBoth sides passionate\n\nSame-sex marriage is already legal in the District of Columbia and 19 U.S states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage would essentially end a patchwork of state laws -- some that allow it, some that prohibit it, and a few that allow protections short of marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships.\n\nMarriage equality supporters cheered the high court's Monday order.\n\n\"Today's decision by the Supreme Court leaves in force five favorable marriage rulings reached in three federal appellate courts, ensuring the freedom to marry for millions more Americans around the country,\" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry.\n\n\"But we are one country, with one Constitution, and the court's delay in affirming the freedom to marry nationwide prolongs the patchwork of state-to-state discrimination and the harms and indignity that the denial of marriage still inflicts on too many couples in too many places.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court hurried to schedule the appeals from the five states for its closed-door conference, even before all the legal briefs had been filed. But the justices offered no explanation of why they are not ready to resolve the issue.\n\nSome conservative activists say the high court should stay out of same-sex marriage issues.\n\n\"When the court on such an issue -- where there are very strong opinions on both sides, and a huge issue of social change in our country -- steps in and makes it into a constitutional issue, it makes the justices look significantly more political in the eyes of the American people,\" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network.\n\n\"It would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the court ... by imposing one type of solution for the entire nation, instead of leaving it in the hands of the states to decide how they want to address this issue.\"\n\nMany supporters of \"traditional\" marriage privately say preserving an inflexible one-man/one-woman definition of wedlock nationwide would not be realistic moving forward, and that a divided bloc of states upholding the status quo may be the best possible scenario. But all that hinges on what the Supreme Court does.\n\nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring, the first state attorney general to argue successfully at the district and appeals level for a marriage ban to be struck down, said \"a new day has dawned, and the rights guaranteed by our Constitution are shining through.\"\n\nSame-sex precedent\n\nA federal appeals court in August took just nine days after intensive oral arguments to issue its sweeping conclusion that voter-approved same-sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin were unacceptably discriminatory. And state leaders then took just five days to formally ask the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nEven Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently hinted that a \"Why wait?\" attitude may predominate.\n\n\"I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,\" she told The Associated Press in July, referring to interracial marriage, a ban on which was not struck down by the high court until 1967. \"If a case is properly before the court, they will take it.\"\n\nIt takes just four of the nine justices to put such petitions on the docket -- but five, of course, to ultimately prevail on the merits.\n\nState and federal judges in the past year have ruled 39 times in favor of the expanded marriage right, while two have upheld existing laws. All this follows what the Supreme Court in 2013 said peripherally on the issue.\n\nFifteen months ago, the justices cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after it ruled private parties did not have \"standing\" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock.\n\nMore importantly, the high court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 \"Windsor\" decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits, such as tax breaks.\n\nThat federal question now morphs into the higher-stakes state jurisdiction, where marriage laws have traditionally been controlled, and where the equal protection issues will ultimately be resolved.\n\nBy CNN's count, various individuals and gay rights groups have launched more than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in all 31 states with current bans. A Supreme Court review would put all that litigation on hold.\n\nHowever, the nine justices had complete discretion to stand on the sidelines for now and wait for a majority of these state battles to play out, or for a federal appeals court to uphold a ban.\n\nCNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this story."}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 16, 19, 5, 10, 14, 15, 4, 6, 12], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "The U.N.

Office on Drugs and Crime issued its Afghanistan Cannabis Survey on Wednesday, documenting large-scale cannabis cultivation in half of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.\n\n\"While other countries have even larger cannabis cultivation, the astonishing yield of the Afghan cannabis crop -- 145 kilograms per hectare of hashish, the resin produced from cannabis, as compared to around 40 kilograms per hectare in Morocco -- makes Afghanistan the world's biggest producer of hashish, estimated at between 1,500 and 3,500 tons a year,\" said Antonio Maria Costa, UNODC's executive director, in a report issued at the agency's headquarters in Vienna, Austria.\n\nThe survey results reflect the significance of Afghanistan's illicit drug trade, exploited by militants to fund their operations in unstable areas, such as the country's war-torn southern region. In 2008, \"a massive seizure of cannabis -- 245,000 kilograms -- was made in Kandahar near the Pakistan border.\"\n\n\"All drugs in Afghanistan, whether opium or cannabis, are taxed by those who control the territory, providing an additional source of revenue for insurgents,\" Costa said.\n\nThe study said the high concentration of cannabis cultivation in the south \"marks a shift away from the north, which even five years ago, was the main cannabis-growing region. Illustrative of this trend is the steep increase in cannabis prices in Balkh province\" because of a crackdown since 2007.\n\nThe report says money \"is one of the main reasons\" for large-scale cannabis cultivation.\n\n\"The gross income per hectare of cannabis (US $3,900) is higher than from opium (US$ 3,600). Cannabis does not need much labor cost: in Afghanistan it is three times cheaper to cultivate a hectare of cannabis than a hectare of opium.\n\n\"As a result, the net income of a hectare of cannabis is US $3,341 compared to US $2,005 per hectare of opium. In the aggregate, however, because opium cultivation far exceeds cannabis cultivation, in 2009 the value of cannabis resin production in Afghanistan was estimated at between US $39-94 million, about 10-20 percent of the farmgate value of opium production.\"\n\nCosta said the report shows that Afghanistan's drug problem \"is even more complex than just the opium trade.\"\n\n\"Reducing Afghanistan's cannabis supply should be dealt with more seriously as part of the national drug control strategy. As with opium, the bottom line is to improve security and development in drug-producing regions in order to wean farmers off of illicit crops and into sustainable, licit livelihoods, and to deny insurgents another source of illicit income.\""}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 13, 16, 4, 6, 10, 14, 19, 15, 12], "scores": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3], "summary": "American college student Amanda Knox, 21, told a courtroom Friday that she was found dead at her boyfriend's home the night Kercher was killed.\nShe was at her boyfriend's house all night and not at home, where Kercher's body was found the next day.\nShe checked her e-mails at his place before the couple had dinner, watched a movie, smoked a marijuana joint, made love and fell asleep.\nKnox said she figured one of her housemates had simply stepped out for an errand.", "text": "ROME, Italy (CNN)  -- American college student Amanda Knox told an Italian courtroom Friday that she was at the home of her boyfriend the night her roommate was killed two years ago, her attorney said.\n\nAmerican college student Amanda Knox, 21,  testifies Friday at her murder trial in Perugia, Italy.\n\nWhen she later was told that her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher, was found dead, Knox said in Italian, \"I was like, 'No, no, how can this be?' \"\n\nKnox, a 21-year-old from Seattle, Washington, testified that she was at her boyfriend's apartment, smoking marijuana, on the night Kercher was killed. Both Knox and the boyfriend are charged with murder and sexual assault in the case.\n\nShe said she later gave a confused and conflicting deposition to police because she was confused by the questioning and felt pressure from the investigators.\n\nShe testified that on the night of November 1, 2007, when Kercher was killed, she was at her boyfriend's house all night and not at home, where Kercher's body was found the next day.  Watch Knox take the stand \u00bb\n\nKnox is scheduled to resume testifying Saturday, when prosecutors plan to question her. The trial opened January 16.\n\nAfter her testimony Friday, Knox's father, Kurt Knox, said he thought his daughter did well on the stand and predicted that her innocence would become more apparent as the trial continues.\n\nKercher family attorney Francesco Maresca, however, said the Knox on the stand Friday was a different person from the Amanda Knox seen at a preliminary hearing. She questioned who the real Amanda Knox is.\n\nOn the stand Friday, Knox said she was with her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, on the night of November 1. She said she checked her e-mails at his place before the couple had dinner, watched a movie, smoked a marijuana joint, made love and fell asleep.\n\nIn the morning, Knox testified, she went home to the villa she shared with Kercher to take a shower. That's when she noticed a series of \"strange things,\" including dried blood in the sink and on the bath mat, unflushed feces in the toilet and a locked door to Kercher's room.\n\nThe door to the villa had been left open, too, but Knox said she figured one of her housemates had simply stepped out quickly for an errand or to go for a run. She said she called out but nobody answered.\n\nWhen Knox got back to Sollecito's house, she told him about the strange things, and he suggested they call the police, Knox testified. Sollecito called his sister, a member of the Carabinieri, the Italian military police, Knox said.\n\nThey returned to the girls' villa to check whether anything had been stolen, Knox said. Once there they met Knox's other roommate, Filomena Romanelli, and the Italian Postal Police.  Watch Knox in court \u00bb\n\nAs Knox stood outside, police went in and began shouting and banging down Kercher's door, Knox said. Between trying to understand what police were saying and having Sollecito translate for her, Knox testified that she got a confused picture of what was going on.\n\nShe sat in Romanelli's car to warm up, and that's when she heard Kercher was dead, Knox said.\n\n\"I closed in inside myself,\" Knox testified in Italian. Continuing in Italian, but using English phrasing, she said, \"I was like, 'No, no, how can this be?' \"\n\nKercher's body was found half-naked in her bed November 2, 2007. Prosecutors have said Kercher, 21, died in a \"drug-fueled sex game\" with Knox and Sollecito, now 25. An investigating judge found that Kercher died fighting off a sexual assault.\n\nA third person, Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede, was convicted of murder in a fast-track trial in October and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He is appealing the verdict.\n\nDefense attorneys are expected to argue that sloppy police work tainted the physical evidence.\n\nKercher suffered a knife wound to the neck. In court papers, prosecutors alleged that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her.\n\nProsecutors have said that they have physical evidence placing the defendants at the scene and that the suspects gave investigators confusing and contradictory statements about their whereabouts the night Kercher died.\n\nKnox first said she was at the house she shared with Kercher but then changed her story, according to court records. Sollecito said he was never at the house but was at his apartment, watching a movie on his computer with Knox. Later, he told investigators he did not remember whether Knox was with him the entire night.\n\nKnox, wearing a short-sleeve white top, beige trousers and a ponytail, testified that she gave a November 6 deposition to police that was confusing because she felt pressured and intimidated by the way police were conducting the investigation.\n\nAnother reason that Knox cited for giving a confused and conflicting deposition is that she did not realize that police planned to interrogate her that day.\n\n\"The declarations were taken against my will, and they were taken in a state of confusion and pressure by the police,\" Knox testified before a packed courtroom, filled mostly with members of the media.\n\nKnox testified that an interpreter was there and encouraged her to remember facts, which led her to say things that she later retracted.\n\nShe said police repeatedly called her a liar and mistreated her. When an attorney pointed out that police offered her tea at the end of questioning, he said it indicated that they treated her well.\n\n\"No,\" Knox replied firmly.\n\nIt was that confusion that led Knox to hand-write a statement November 7 laying out all that she knew and didn't about the slaying.\n\n\"I know I didn't kill Meredith. That's all I know for sure,\" Knox wrote in the statement, widely reported in the news.\n\n\"That night, it seems to me I was in Raffaele's house,\" she wrote. \"After dinner I noticed the blood on Raffaele's hands, but I was under the impression it was blood from the fish.\"\n\nOn the stand Friday, Knox said she wrote the statement of her own will.\n\n\"I was not sure what was my imagination and what was my reality,\" she said. \"Therefore I was confused. I knew I had to write this statement, so I made it clear when I signed that I was confused.\"\n\nKnox, who testified in both English and fluent Italian, is also being sued by local bar owner Patrick Lumumba for defamation of character. He was arrested early in the case but was released for lack of evidence.\n\nKnox worked at his bar and initially told police that Lumumba was present when Kercher was killed.\n\nOn November 10, more than a week after the slaying, Knox told her mother from jail that she felt bad and felt responsible for Lumumba being behind bars. Asked by Lumumba's attorney Friday why she didn't share that information with police -- knowing it might cast doubt on his guilt -- Knox said it was because she didn't feel comfortable answering their questions.\n\n\"Quite frankly, I didn't have a good relationship with either the police or the public [prosecutor], because even he tried to suggest the answers I should give,\" Knox testified.\n\nThe trial is taking place in Perugia, a university town about 115 miles (185 kilometers) north of Rome.\n\nA panel of eight judges is hearing the case. The trial has drawn more than 140 journalists from 86 news outlets to the courthouse in Perugia.\n\nThe presiding judge, Giancarlo Massei, has barred cameras from the courtroom and said he could completely close portions of the trial dealing with the most graphic sexual assault allegations."}, {"annotators_ids": [15, 4, 5, 10, 19, 14, 16, 6, 12, 13], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "Gareth Bale will be unveiled at Real's Bernabeu Stadium Monday.\nNeither club has disclosed the value of the deal.\nTottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club had no intention of selling Bale.\nThe 24-year-old has twice been named the Footballer of the Year in England.", "text": "(CNN) -- Spanish football club Real Madrid completed the signing of Gareth Bale from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur Sunday, to end weeks of speculation over one of the off-season's most anticipated transfer deals.\n\nBale joins the La Liga giants for six seasons, Real said on its website, and he will be unveiled at Real's Bernabeu Stadium Monday at 1 p.m. local time.\n\nNeither club has disclosed the value of the deal but British media outlets Sky Sports and the BBC reported it was a world-record move worth $132 million that was greater than the $124 million fee Real Madrid produced to lure Cristiano Ronaldo away from Manchester United in 2009.\n\nAccording to a pair of Spanish newspapers, though, Bale's switch wasn't a world record.

[Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton recently made some remarks that United States drug consumption is partially to blame for this problem. Do you agree with that?\n\nSantana: Totally. I think that the solution to all of this stuff would be to legalize it, decriminalize it, reinvest all that money into teachers in schools. ...\n\nIf we would teach in schools the incredible sensation of climax that it feels to be of service to other people -- like Mother Teresa, or Desmond Tutu or the Dalai Lama -- smoking pot, and drinking tequila, and watching porno or whatever people do, it pales in comparison when you actually wake up to be of service to people.\n\nTo go back to the question -- I think we should legalize marijuana. I think Barack Obama should bring the brothers and sisters home -- the soldiers. If I was to see him, I would go, \"Listen to Marvin Gaye's 'What's Going On' and John Coltrane, and bring the boys home from the war now, like we did with Vietnam.\" They're not going to come here. People in Vietnam did not come here to attack us after we left them alone. So let's get rid of that fear, that fantasy, that stuff. Let's get rid of the bogeyman, because the bogeyman is us looking in the mirror of each other.\n\nCNN: What about when people don't get it, Carlos? What if they're listening to you and thinking, \"He sounds like one of those New Age Californians, and I really don't get what they're doing out there.\"\n\nSantana: Well, they don't get it because they're stuck in something that is not working. Like, for example, a lot of people are stuck with certain parts of the Bible, believing that God is vengeful and jealous. That's Godzilla! I'm not stuck with a God like that. I'm stuck with a God that's all love, all compassion, all light, and he only sees you with purity and innocence, like the brand-new eyes of a child that's just been born. ...\n\nA lot about Las Vegas is illusion. It's entertainment and show business. We don't know none of that. We only know to go into your heart and help you remember that it's there. I know a lot of rich millionaires who are not happy, and you're only happy when you're doing something.\n\nCNN: Are you happy?\n\nSantana: I'm very, very happy because I'm grateful.

Bowe Bergdahl -- the only American soldier held as a captive -- for five Taliban prisoners.\n\nU.S. diplomats had been carrying out \"extremely sensitive discussions\" with Taliban intermediaries, a U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe Taliban said the discussions were taking place in Qatar, where the group opened an office last year.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid sent a statement saying the group has called for the talks to be suspended.\n\n\"The leadership of the Islamic Emirate has decided to suspend the process for some time due to the current complex political situation in the country,\" the statement said. \"The process will remain suspended without the exchange of the prisoners until our decision to resume.\"\n\nMujahid did not say what \"complex political situation\" the statement referred to.\n\nBergdahl has been held by insurgents in Pakistan since 2009.\n\nTaliban leaders 'appreciate' Karzai\n\nAnother statement released by a Taliban spokesman Sunday said a high-ranking delegation recently met in an \"atmosphere of peace and sincerity\" with representatives of the Afghan High Peace Council in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Taliban representatives \"appreciate\" Afghan President Hamid Karzai's release of 65 prisoners in February, the statement said. It credited the release \"as a reply to our previous demands in this regard.\"\n\nU.S officials strongly objected to the release of men who they said pose a threat to security forces and civilians. The group included an alleged Taliban explosives expert, a suspected Haqqani network commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices.\n\n\"These individuals are dangerous,\" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. \"They pose threats to the safety and security of the Afghan people and the Afghan state.\"\n\nNegotiating with terrorists\n\nAmerican officials are adamant that they have never given up on trying to get Bergdahl back and resist calling the current effort \"renewed\" discussions. But driving the current effort, according to the U.S. official, is Bergdahl's poor health and concern that a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan at year's end would essentially close the door on any rescue attempt.\n\nThe United States has long declared that it won't negotiate with terrorists, which is what it considers the Taliban. However, \"we have a history of being able to dance pretty effectively along the edges of the declaration,\" said retired Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks, a CNN military analyst.\n\nOpinion: Should the U.S. negotiate with terrorists?\n\nPossible obstacle\n\nOne possible obstacle to securing Bergdahl's release is what may be asked in return. The Taliban have long demanded the release of five detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but another U.S. official said that releasing them would be difficult because Congress would have to be notified in advance, and lawmakers have previously resisted releasing them.\n\nVan Hipp, who served as a deputy assistant Army secretary under former President George H.W. Bush, said that trading Guantanamo inmates for Bergdahl would put at risk \"every American soldier deployed all over the world.\"\n\n\"We are sending the message to terrorist organizations all over the world that it's OK to capture an American soldier, that America will deal with you,\" said Hipp, now a defense consultant in Washington.\n\n\"I think we need to give the green light to the Special Ops and let them do their jobs quietly and methodically, as they have done so well in the past,\" he added.\n\nWho is Bowe Bergdahl?\n\nFits and starts\n\nIn May 2012, the U.S. government acknowledged that it had been engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl, but those talks moved in fits and starts because of U.S. concerns that any Taliban prisoners swapped for the sergeant might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight.\n\nBergdahl, of Wood River Valley, Idaho, appeared in diminished health in a video that the U.S. military obtained in January. His family also received a letter from him last year via the Red Cross.\n\nThe United States believes that one route to getting Bergdahl back may be through Qatari officials, who have been talking to the Taliban. But Bergdahl is believed to be held by operatives from the Haqqani network, an insurgent force affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda -- and it was not clear whether Haqqani operatives would abide by any agreement among the United States, Qatar and the Taliban.\n\nCNN's Nic Robertson, Matt Smith and Barbara Starr contributed to this report"}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 12, 13, 16, 19, 4, 10, 14, 15, 6], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], "summary": "The cases that come to court cover the full spectrum of grievances and bizarre incidents.\nDalton Floyd Jr. of South Carolina's Floyd Law Firm has made a 40-year-plus career.\nHe gives an example where neither the claimant nor the appellant were left with a good leg to stand on.\nMost golf holes have yardage markers dotted on the fairway.", "text": "(CNN) -- The next time you step foot on a golf course, beware the legal minefield that can await you.\n\nIf the game was not difficult enough already, it has a well-deserved reputation of being the most litigious of all sports, bar none.\n\nThe cases that come to court cover the full spectrum of grievances and bizarre incidents, from the elderly Irish pensioner suing his former golf club for cutting -- yes cutting -- his handicap, to two-time major winner Rory McIlroy going legal in a high-stakes wrangle over his multimillion-dollar deal with Nike.\n\nFrom players tripping over rabbit holes, to a pair of New York doctors involved in a landmark legal action after one of them was blinded by the other's errant shot.\n\nIt all backs up the main thrust of a publication from 2007 by Craig Brown, a law professor at the University of Western Ontario in Canada.\n\n\"Golf and the law seem to have been made for each other,\" he wrote in \"Why Lawyers Love Golf.\"\n\n\"On every fairway, in every stretch of rough, in every clubhouse, in every golf bag, at every swing at the ball, in every set of plans for a new course, in every application for club membership, there lurks a potential lawsuit.\"\n\nDalton Floyd Jr. of South Carolina's Floyd Law Firm has made a 40-year-plus career of handling such cases.\n\nHe gives an example where neither the claimant nor the appellant were left with a good leg to stand on:\n\n\"A lady and her husband were walking from the tee to her golf cart. In a freak accident she stood on a piece of unmade ground and contrived to rupture her Achilles tendon,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"Both her and husband were keen line dancers, couldn't take part in the activity for months and brought a claim on that basis. The club had to settle.\"\n\nGolfing mousetraps\n\nIt highlighted the fact that golf clubs have to think very carefully about every area of their activity because there are mousetraps everywhere, in the legal sense.\n\nMost golf holes have yardage markers dotted on the fairway to let golfers know how far they are from the green, the most common at 150 yards out.\n\nBut they had better make sure they are accurate.\n\n\"A golfer hit the ball onto a green and hit a player who was waiting to putt,\" recalls Floyd.\n\n\"The golfer hitting the shot claimed the yardage markers put out by the course were inaccurate and he thought the green was further away and out of his reach.\n\n\"The club had to settle the claim because they were liable.\"\n\nAnd beware the hasty and ill-thought-out redesign of a golf course, says Floyd.\n\n\"A club in Hilton Head cut down trees on the left of a dogleg hole, which meant a lot of balls ended up in a big condominium. The owners were not happy and the club was held liable and had to settle.\"\n\nSerious injury\n\nWhile it is easy to poke fun at some of the claims, others are for serious injury sustained in the course of playing the sport.\n\nAs CNN reported in 2010, being hit by a poor shot while playing is a risk golfers assume and this was backed up by New York's highest court in a key ruling.\n\nPlaying at a course in Long Island, Anoop Kapoor hit a shot which struck his fellow doctor Azad Anand in the left eye.\n\nAnand was blinded after the incident and launched a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Kapoor for damages, alleging his friend was negligent for failing to warn of the shot.\n\nKapoor testified he thought Anand was behind him and that he didn't see anyone between him and the hole when he took his shot. Kapoor unintentionally sliced it, striking Anand with terrible consequences.\n\nFloyd says most claims of this nature are dismissed: \"Thank goodness the courts have an understanding that you can't hit the ball straight all the time, particularly the amateur golfer.\n\n\"I think generally we get good decisions from judges because they understand golf is a sport and there is a certain amount of risk when you play.\"\n\nBut that did not stop 15-year-old Alex Good of Hillsboro, Oregon from suing a local golf course for negligence after he hit himself in the eye with his own ball while on its driving range.\n\nAccording to court documents, Good and his high school teammates were using the practice range. It was raining and the staff at Pumpkin Ridge put up an awning.\n\nWhen Good teed off, his ball hit a metal post that was holding up the awning just inches in front of his driving mat. The ball ricocheted off and hit him in the left eye.\n\nGood's lawyer claimed Pumpkin Ridge should have known that the metal pole was a danger. Pumpkin Ridge did not respond to CNN's enquiries about the current status of the suit.\n\nCostly repair\n\nDuring the economic downturn, even well-to-do golfers have felt the pinch, says Floyd, but he warns against what one did to save a few dollars: repairing your own clubs.\n\nHe cites the case of a player who took his tee shot -- then the head of the repaired club flew off and got stuck in his playing partner's knee.\n\nPainful for the claimant -- and costly for the do-it-yourself golfer, who was forced to settle the claim.\n\nIt's not a position in which former world No. 1 McIlroy should ever find himself, but he is embroiled in a very public legal dispute with his former management agency over its role in his contracts with Nike and other key sponsors.\n\nThe 24-year-old from Northern Ireland claims he was misled over the terms of the deals and is seeking compensation.\n\nThe agent, Conor Ridge, and the management company Horizon Sports deny the claim and are counter suing in a case which is slated for the courts in October 2014.\n\nMcIlroy, whose form has slumped since signing the big-money deals, admitted that it had taken a toll. \"I've seen more lawyers' offices and more lawyers this year than I care to see in my entire life,\" he told reporters at the World Tour Championship in Dubai last month.\n\nAngry Tiger\n\nHe also said he was taking advice from Nike stablemate Tiger Woods on how to deal with these pressures, although the world No. 1 himself is at the center of a controversy which threatens to end in a lawsuit.\n\nIn a published article grading the tour performance of top players, former PGA pro and now analyst Brandel Chamblee flunked Woods, questioning his integrity and saying that he had been \"a little cavalier with the rules.\"\n\nAs evidence, he cited three instances where Woods had been penalized for rules infractions and a fourth where an NBC analyst questioned the drop that Woods made after his ball landed in a water hazard.\n\nWoods' agent Mark Steinberg responded angrily over a \"shameful, baseless\" report and said he was considering a legal action for damages.\n\nMcIlroy will doubtless take his own counsel but might look no further than the fate that befell a 75-year-old amateur golfer from across the border in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHandicap blues\n\nThomas Talbot, a retired insurance official, was left with a massive legal bill in excess of $500,000 after launching an action against his former club because it had cut his handicap.\n\nThis would normally be a cause for celebration, but Talbot took it as a slight, particularly as a court in Dublin heard he was accused of \"handicap building\" -- or allegedly playing below his ability to get his handicap raised and thereby be able to win more competitions.\n\nTalbot sued the Hermitage Golf Club and its former handicap secretary in the Irish High Court for defamation, but a judge found against him last year and he has been left with heavy costs.\n\nGolf for a long time was a male-dominated sport but as more women started taking part, clubs which restricted membership came under the legal spotlight for alleged discriminatory practices.\n\nFederal law in the United States now requires clubs open to the public to admit women, but Augusta National, home of the U.S. Masters tournament, was a private club and adopted a strict male-only membership policy for 80 years.\n\nThat suddenly changed in August 2012, when it announced it would admit its first two female members, former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and business leader Darla Moore.\n\nThe volte face came without ever reaching a court of law, but rather thanks to the tireless efforts of women's rights activist Martha Burk and reported pressure from key sponsors.\n\nDiscrimination suits also extended to the top level of men's professional golf when Casey Martin, a former Stanford University teammate of Woods, took out a case against the PGA Tour.\n\nMartin suffers from a debilitating leg deformity that obstructs blood flow back to his heart.\n\nHaving qualified for the full PGA Tour in 2000, Martin wanted to use a golf cart in tournaments, but was refused permission by tour officials.\n\nMartin took a lawsuit on grounds of disability discrimination and finally won his battle in the Supreme Court.\n\nBut he was unable to capitalize on his early promise and dropped off the tour, although he was a surprise qualifier for the 2012 U.S. Open.\n\nTrump challenge\n\nNo article about lawsuits in golf would be complete without mention of U.S. tycoon Donald Trump and his battles to complete a $1 billion development in northern Scotland.\n\nHe faced down opposition from locals and environmental groups, including a lawsuit from an 86-year-old pensioner, to get permission to build his championship course on protected sand dunes in Aberdeenshire.\n\nBut having built the course, now Trump himself has gone legal after the Scottish government gave planning permission to a massive offshore wind farm just off the coast -- and within sight of his new resort.\n\nTrump has called the 11 turbine scheme a \"useless and grotesque blot on our heritage\" and has launched a lawsuit to attempt to stop it.\n\nThe Scottish government, led by First Minister Alex Salmond, wants all the country's electricity demands to be met

Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nHis movies, including \"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,\" are like watching a three-ring circus. They revel in surface, spectacle and sensory overload. They're audaciously, passionately artificial and at the same time unabashedly romantic -- post-modern pop medleys aimed at the heart, not the brain.\n\nPerhaps Luhrmann even identifies with Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby; after all, they're both decadents.\n\nBut Fitzgerald wasn't Gatsby, and Gatsby could never have written such a novel. It takes an observer like Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) to distill the finer sentiments from this sorry tale of the super-rich, and Luhrmann isn't that. He's an extrovert who wants to thrill us and immerse us in his giddy daring. The last thing he wants to do is sit back and watch.\n\nThere are no two ways about it: \"The Great Gatsby\" is misconceived and misjudged, a crude burlesque on what's probably American literature's most precious jewel.\n\nShopping Gatsby: 15 items you'll love\n\nWarning bells go off right from the first shots of a CGI version of New York's Long Island. The camera is in a state of constant agitation, while the actors -- and they're good actors -- seem to have been instructed to vamp. Either that, or they decided it was the only way to compete with the film's garish hot deco.\n\nBut let's give Luhrmann his due: The man does cut a good teaser. The idea to swap Scott Joplin for Jay-Z and ragtime for rap was a bold and brilliant choice. Casting Leonardo DiCaprio as the glamorous, elusive billionaire Gatsby and Maguire as his modest, admiring neighbor was right on.\n\nCarey Mulligan as Daisy wasn't as inspired. She gets the sadness of the character but not the flip side of her personality, and she's just not a bright enough spark to keep Gatsby's torch burning for so long.\n\nAnd shooting in 3-D? Look at \"Hugo\" and \"Life of Pi\": It could have worked.\n\nYet Luhrmann seems utterly bamboozled by the technique, as if it's thrown off his rhythm. The early scenes especially are likely to induce motion sickness, and not just because Nick is getting drunk on New York's high society. We know Luhrmann can throw a wild party, but the movie doesn't build or grow; it just keeps hitting the same high notes until we go numb to the din.\n\nAnd if he's lost in the loud revelry, Luhrmann is completely out of his element in the more intimate scenes. The reunion between Jay and Daisy is played for laughs (and it gets a couple, too), but Luhrmann shortchanges whatever it is that pulls these lovers together.

Henry Waxman\u00a0estimated two weeks ago that as much as $65 billion in government payments to Americans in those states is at risk.\n\nThe Supreme Court case, King v. Burwell, hinges on whether\u00a0the government can legally distribute subsidies in states that use the Healthcare.gov online exchange instead of running their own.\n\nThe law\u2019s language is plain: Subsidies can only be paid through exchanges created by the states.\n\nDemocrats in Congress, defending President Barack Obama's signature law, insist a drafting error is to blame. They say they intended for people in all 50 states to be eligible for subsidies.\n\nBut Jonathan Gruber, the one-time Obamacare 'architect' whose unguarded, videotaped comments about the law drove him to apologize before Congress this month, thought differently in 2012.\n\n'What\u2019s important to remember politically about this,' Gruber told a group of consultants at the management firm Noblis, 'is if you're a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don't get their tax credits \u2013 but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill.'\n\n'So you\u2019re essentially saying [to] your citizens you\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country,' he warned.\n\n'I hope that that's a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges.'\n\nInsurers are bracing for the possibility that 87 per cent of their new customers in the 34 states without insurance exchanges could suddenly find Obamacare policies financially out of reach \u2013 leading to lapsed premiums and a systemwide collapse.\n\nSome companies have slipped excape clauses into their policy contracts, The Daily Caller reports, allowing them to cancel the plans if the high court invalidates the subsidies.\n\nTuesday's HHS report included data from only one month; the open enrollment period stretches through February 15.\n\n'About 87 percent of people who selected health insurance plans through HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2015 were determined eligible for financial assistance to lower their monthly premiums,' the agency reproted, 'compared to 80 percent of enrollees who selected plans over a similar period last year.\n\nObamacare subsidies can come in the form of tax credits that compensate for varying percentages of premiums. They can also consist of government payments that directly lower enrollees' out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTax credits are available to everyone earning less than 400 per cent of the poverty limit. Those under 250 per cent of that benchmark can get the direct subsidies for 'silver' level insurance policies..\n\nThe final cost of insurance is capped at 9.5 per cent of total income for anyone who qualifies.\n\nAmericans can apply different levels of health insurance subsidies next year, depending on the size of their families and how much they earn; about 87 per cent of enrolees so far this fall qualified for at least some taxpayer-funded payout\n\nAt 138 per cent of the poverty level, Americans become eligible for Medicaid and pay nothing for their care.\n\nThe poverty limit for a family of four in 2014 was $23,850, and will increase in 2015 with inflation.\n\nThat means a two-parent household with two children can get government help for Obamacare this year unless its earnings top $95,400.\n\nIncome below\u00a0$32,913 makes the family eligible for Medicaid coverage.\n\nAccording to a Kaiser Foundation online calculator, the same family could opt for an $8,290 'silver' level insurance policy and pay about $600 for it after subsidies are applied.\n\nWith a $50,000 family income, they would only be responsible for $3,300 in premium payments for the year."}, {"annotators_ids": [15, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 4], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Public Warehousing Company KSC is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States.\nThe company obtained contracts in May 2003, February 2005 and July 2005 to feed U.S. troops in Iraq, Kuwait and Jordan.\nThe indictment alleges PWC submitted false information and manipulated prices to overcharge for food.\nPublic Warehousing Company, also known as Agility, did not return a telephone message Monday.", "text": "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Kuwaiti company that has been paid more than $8.5 billion to supply food and other items to the U.S. military in the Middle East has been indicted on multiple federal fraud charges, authorities announced Monday.\n\nPublic Warehousing Company KSC is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, committing major fraud against the United States, making false statements, submitting false claims and wire fraud, a six-count indictment states.\n\nThe company obtained contracts in May 2003, February 2005 and July 2005 to feed U.S. troops in Iraq, Kuwait and Jordan, said the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Georgia, where the charges were filed.\n\n\"This indictment is the result of a multiyear probe into abuses in vendor contracts in the Middle East involving the illegal inflation of prices in contracts to feed our troops,\" said F.

And 21 million people can't find rental homes within their means. The struggle for decent, affordable rental housing is increasingly out of reach not only for the poorest of the poor, but for the middle class as well.\n\nSome might ask: Why should the rest of us care? Why not let the market determine what is available and for how much?\n\nWe should care because the supply of decent and affordable housing is crucial to any local economy. When millions of people spend the bulk of what they earn on rent, it's bad for business.\n\nAffordable housing is key to sustaining successful communities. Employers can't readily hire the workers they need if those workers can't find a decent place to live nearby. When a long, expensive commute stands between families and their jobs, schools or doctors, those families become financially unstable and pull down the communities around them.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio recognized the extent of the stunning erosion of the city's affordable housing supply (as did his predecessor Michael Bloomberg) and set a goal of adding 200,000 low-cost homes over the next 10 years. That would mean building or preserving units at a rate of about 55 a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the erosion continues: Before de Blasio's first term ends, more than 45,000 existing lower-cost homes will return to market value when restrictions that keep them affordable expire, according to NYU's Furman Center.\n\nOn May 1, the mayor is set to introduce his plan for how to address the accelerating demand for affordable housing. But that demand won't be met without effective tools that enable the public and private sectors to invest in new housing while preserving existing ones.\n\nConstructing affordable housing is not only hard to do, it's just not enough. For every new unit created, at least two are lost. In hot real estate markets such as New York, regulations expire; in cooler markets, affordable units are overcome by age and decay.\n\nIt is far more costly to create homes than to preserve what's already there. Any real solution, in addition to looking to new construction, must also look to preservation.\n\nThe Lower East Side neighborhood of Jacksonville, Florida, is a fine example of how preservation can work. Four years ago, the apartments at 887 Franklin St. were so derelict and dangerous that government housing officials considered pulling their funding, portending disaster for a neighborhood already reeling under the weight of recession and investment flight.\n\nToday, after a $5 million renovation by new owner Ability Housing of Northeast Florida, the 60-unit Oakland Terrace is a clean, well-lit and safe place for families to live, complete with a new playground that residents and their children helped design. The neighborhood now has the potential to become economically stronger.\n\nOakland Terrace was financed through a public-private partnership made possible by the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, and improvements to the property were largely paid for through an equity investment provided by a key private sector partner, TD Bank.\n\nBut for every Oakland Terrace, America faces many more unresolved affordable housing challenges. A $26 billion capital-needs backlog that's associated with our publicly financed affordable housing stock looms.\n\nTraditional federal subsidies that enable affordability -- such as Section 8, which authorizes rental housing payment assistance to private landlords on behalf of more than 3 million low-income households -- are being cut back. Federal housing subsidy programs such as HOME were slashed this year. These vital programs need to be preserved and expanded.\n\nOther important tools are at the ready, but sadly, they are inactive or underutilized.\n\nBack in 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the National Housing Trust Fund, requiring at least 90% of its funds be used to build, preserve or rehabilitate rental housing for low-income households. But this program and others like it have yet to receive the funding that was envisioned by the law.\n\nAnother valuable initiative is the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program, which enables private developers to work with public housing authorities to preserve affordable housing. But it has only been funded for up to 60,000 housing units.\n\nSo while RAD offers promise to select cities such as Baltimore, San Francisco and Houston, hundreds more housing authorities from Los Angeles to Little Rock, Arkansas, to Lackawanna, New York, are waiting for Congress to lift the cap so that desperately needed private capital can flow to aging public housing.\n\nExpanding LIHTC -- the federal tax credit for low-income housing that was instrumental in the preservation of Oakland Terrace -- is another important step. This Reagan-era policy gives the private sector an incentive to create and invest in affordable housing and helps finance more than 100,000 new rental units every year. These tax credits enable affordable rents for low income and middle class families and is often used to create mixed-income developments. Such housing is a critical resource for working families.\n\nTo date, LIHTC has financed the development of more than 2.6 million affordable rental homes across the country, leveraging more than $100 billion in private capital in the process. The Bipartisan Policy Center recently called for expanding the tax credit by 50% over current funding levels to help close the gap between the costs of producing or preserving properties and the equity and debt that can be raised from the private sector to support them.\n\nThis isn't about handouts. It's about using tools we already know are shown to work to preserve and expand our nation's supply of decent homes working people can afford. Only then can employers hire the workers they need and families hold their financial footing.\n\nOnly then can local communities thrive."}, {"annotators_ids": [15, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 4, 5, 12, 19], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "The very first blanket each newborn is wrapped in is so popular amongst new parents they often choose not to give them back.\nThe Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney said it was a common phenomenon that the blankets simply disappeared.\nAt least one third of the baby blankets are never make it back for laundering.\nRon Marks said the blankets were a 'high loss item'.", "text": "Mothers love them, babies love them, even the family dog loves them - and if you were to peek into the average Australian family's linen closet, you would no doubt find one.\n\nThe very first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most New South Wales hospitals is so popular amongst new parents that they often choose not to give them back.\n\nA spokesperson from the Royal Hospital for Women (RHW) in Sydney admitted that it was a common phenomenon that the blankets simply disappeared.\n\nThe very first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most New South Wales hospitals is so popular amongst  parents that they often choose not to give them back\n\n'It's one of those unfortunate things that happen, some mother really do like them - they just go into the suitcase an no one is any the wiser,' she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'There's nothing special about them, but they are quite thick and warm for new born babies.

First class can be fitted at the customer airline's discretion.\n\nIt's a lot to get your head around when you look at the airplane as it is today.\n\n\"Flight crew class\" is what Azar laughingly calls the 50 odd well-worn gray seats the jet is currently fitted with, all recovered from old aircraft.

And everyone broke down at the table,\" he said.\n\nThe marriage took place after a service filled with African drums, dancing, sermons and family and friends sharing memories of Asa, all in celebration of his life.\n\nMiller said about 1,100 people attended the service, with hundreds overflowing onto the church lawn, where sound systems were set up so they could hear the service. When the wedding was announced, there were shocked cheers and applause from those in the church pews.\n\n\"We wanted it to be a surprise,\" Hill said. \"We knew it would be a joyous moment. You could see how it lifted them, and we figured, why not make it a surprise at the end.\"\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Church was chosen because its non-denominational tradition would welcome all the diverse groups of the Elmwood community, Hill said. The family has strong ties to the community and, according to Miller, who had known Asa since he was 5, Asa embodied this.\n\n\"He was a powerful presence: direct, smart, and had a way of bringing people together,\" Miller said. \"When you met him, you knew you met someone. We all didn't know each other, but we knew Asa and his family.\""}, {"annotators_ids": [16, 19, 6, 15, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14, 12], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Robin van Persie has accused Emmanuel Adebayor of trying to deliberately injure him.\nAdebayor left Arsenal for City in July for a fee in $40 million.\nAdebayor spent three-and-a-half years at Arsenal.\nHe has shown a real lack of class to the fans.", "text": "(CNN) -- Arsenal forward Robin van Persie has accused former teammate Emmanuel Adebayor of deliberately trying to injure him with a stamp during their English Premier League defeat to Manchester City.\n\nRobin van Persie has accused Emmanuel Adebayor of trying to deliberately injure him.\n\nAdebayor, who left Arsenal for City in July for a fee in the region of $40 million, seemed to lunge at the Dutch international who sustained a cut on the side of his head which required treatment.\n\nMatch referee Mark Clattenburg did not get a clear view of the incident in a match which City won 4-2 at Eastlands and Adebayor escaped punishment following the van Persie incident, although he was booked for his goal celebration in front of the Arsenal fans after he ran the full length of the pitch.\n\nFootball Association chief executive Ian Watmore has confirmed the governing body will take a \"good close look\" at the two incidents involving Adebayor who scored in the 80th minute.\n\nBut van Persie directed his ire towards Togo international Adebayor, who spent three-and-a-half years at the Emirates Stadium before his move to City, with a statement on the official Arsenal Web site.\n\nDo you think the FA should punish Adebayor for his conduct?

The farm-to-table vehicle stands out in Greenville, South Carolina, even among the new gastropubs that dot the city's charming Main Street.\n\nToday Zanardelli and Foster are zooming around their rented kitchen on the edge of town, preparing deep-fried Brussels sprouts, Ramen with seaweed and pumpkin sweet rolls. They won't have time after their 12-hour work day to explore the new health insurance marketplaces that opened this morning, but they look forward to seeing what Obamacare can offer them.\n\nAnd that's good news for health care insurance companies.\n\nYoung and fit people like Zanardelli, 31, and Foster, 28, have to buy into the system to support the law's mandate that all people must have health insurance next year. Under Obamacare, companies can no longer deny policies to people with pre-existing conditions, and some 48 million Americans are uninsured, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau figures.\n\nWhat insurance companies will save on medical costs for the healthier population will help pay for the older, sicker people who are entering into the insurance market for the first time. But because they're young -- and don't foresee getting sick any time soon -- some Millennials may decide to skip insurance and risk paying a fine.\n\nZanardelli and Foster have health insurance now, but it's pricey and \"it covers nothing,\" Zanardelli said. She hasn't been to the doctor in years and shells out about $200 a month. Her policy doesn't cover prescriptions either.\n\n\"If it's not generic, I can't afford it.\"\n\nShe says her family warned her about this when she left her teaching job in Charlotte to follow her passion for cooking.\n\n\"One of the first things my parents said was that I was really going to miss that good health insurance, and they were right. I'm healthy, but I really do,\" Zaradelli said. \"Ultimately, though, it's worth it. ... This doesn't feel like work to me. I love what I do. New insurance will make this even better.\"\n\nThe owners of Neue Southern met in 2011 when they enrolled in the culinary arts program at Johnson and Wales University in Charlotte.\n\nThe two chose to move to South Carolina after working under well-known chefs in New York. The foodie fast lane, they decided, wasn't for them. When they scanned the country for opportunities, the food trucks in their East Village neighborhood inspired them. Why not bring a slice of the East Village to Greenville, where Foster got his first taste of cooking in the kitchen of his German-born grandmother?\n\nThey were true foodie pioneers. Zanardelli says the people of Greenville welcomed their European take on old Southern favorites, but when it comes to health insurance they may have been better off somewhere else.\n\nSouth Carolina ranks near the bottom in the nation when it comes to access to care and health outcomes, according to the latest edition of America's Health Rankings.\n\nWhile Obamacare is federal legislation, the Supreme Court ruled that states could decide how they would handle the implementation. Leaders in South Carolina have been downright antagonistic to the legislation.\n\n\"Just because the Supreme Court says something is constitutional doesn't make it constitutional,\" one South Carolina state senator, who introduced an anti-Obamacare bill this year, told the Spartanburg Herald-Journal.\n\nThe senator's bill failed, as did others -- one of which would actually have made it a crime for a state or federal official to implement any provision of Obamacare -- but the state did successfully refuse to expand Medicaid. It has not set up its own health care marketplace.\n\nObamacare exchanges 101: What you need to know\n\n\"We don't talk politics around here because there goes half our client base, either way,\" Foster said while mixing the base for the Ramen. \"But politics aside... we need something better than what we have.\"\n\nFor the more than 726,000 people in South Carolina without insurance there are parts of the federal legislation that will help them. Many will be able to buy policies through the federal health insurance marketplaces. And many, such as the chefs of Neue Southern, will be eligible for tax breaks and subsidies to help them pay for any policies bought through these marketplaces.\n\nThe policies themselves will also be much more comprehensive.\n\nAll health insurance plans will now have to cover preventative health care and at least nine other kinds of care, including hospitalization, outpatient care, emergency services, mental health and substance abuse care, maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs, lab tests, rehab, and pediatric care. Premiums will vary depending on the depth of coverage. Out-of-pocket costs for an individual are capped at $6,350.\n\nInfographic: Obamacare insurance rates\n\nWhen Zanardelli and Foster do get a break from work they say they will shop around and figure out which policy best fits their needs.\n\nHealth care coverage could come in handy right now for Foster. He struggled with a double ear infection for weeks. A doctor at the local urgent care center told him ear drops would cost him $130; he paid to avoid permanent damage to his ears. Now he has a sinus infection. Unfortunately, even if he were to buy insurance through the exchanges today, the policies won't kick in until January.\n\nNot having insurance, they say, is not an option -- even if the fine would be a lot cheaper than the least expensive policy option.\n\n\"I think of this as an investment in our future health care,\" Zanardelli said. \"Most of the younger people we hear object to Obamacare are looking at the present and how it affects them now. We are relatively healthy, but in a few decades we will likely need medical attention.\"\n\n\"We feel optimistic it will be something that can work better for us health wise and be affordable,\" she continued. \"That would be a beautiful thing.\""}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 4, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 6, 12], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Tiger Woods faces two challengers at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.\nThe 34-year-old has been at the summit for 612 weeks in total.\nMickelson can finally surpass Woods if he wins, or if he finishes in the top four and his compatriot is outside the top 37.\nWoods will partner Westwood for the first two rounds of the tournament.", "text": "(CNN) -- Tiger Woods faces two challengers as he bids to retain the world's No. 1 golf ranking for a 271st week at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational starting in Ohio on Thursday.\n\nThe 34-year-old has been at the summit for an unprecedented 612 weeks in total, but once again faces the prospect of losing top spot to fellow American Phil Mickelson -- and a new contender, world No. 3 Lee Westwood.\n\nWhile second-ranked Mickelson has failed to take advantage of Woods' struggles in recent weeks, finishing only tied for 48th at the British Open, Westwood has racked up the points after placing second at his home major last month.\n\nThe Englishman can go to No. 1 if he wins at Firestone and Woods is outside the top two -- or if he is second, the defending champion is 10th or lower and Mickelson does not win.\n\nMickelson can finally surpass Woods if he wins, or if he finishes in the top four and his compatriot is outside the top 37.\n\n\"Am I conscious of the pack closing in?

No probably not - as Barcelona don't look too bothered now. We can hope though.\n\nIt's been a fine performance from Barcelona tonight - and the fans are recognising that by chanting Luis Enrique's name again.\n\nUnsurprisingly Messi has been brilliant - but so have debutants Munir and Ivan Rakitic. This team could take a lot of stopping this season.\n\nThey have turned it down a notch now though - back into first gear for the Catalans as they see out the final minutes of the game.\n\nAdrian comes on for Pasalic.\n\nSergio Roberto comes on to replace tonight's Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta. Lionel Messi takes the armband.\n\nIt's gone a little quiet here at the Nou Camp - substitute Pedro has the best chance since Messi's second goal but he is denied by the excellent Tyton.\n\nDuring this lull - here's a video of the earlier 'cat' incident:\n\nScorer of the second goal, Munir, gets a standing ovation from the Nou Camp crowd after a brilliant debut that was capped with that great finish to tie things up at the beginning of the second half.\n\nThe 68,105-strong Catalan crowd think they've seen their next big star - and who's to argue with them after that?\n\nThink the World Cup would leave Messi tired? You thought wrong. This time he beats three defenders - one of them twice - and slots the ball into the corner of the net.\n\nHe latched on to Dani Alves' pass inside the area and didn't look to be posing too much of a threat until some trademark close-control took him away from multiple markers and opening up the opportunity for Messi to find the corner. Brilliant goal.\n\nPasalic impedes Iniesta on the half-way line and goes into the referee's book.\n\nThey're not throwing players forward at will anymore but Barcelona are still creating chances. Tyton flies off his line to deny Munir with his feet after Messi plays him in on goal. In fairness to the young forward the ball was stuck under his feet and he was left with little chance to finish.\n\nJose Angel comes off with Alvaro replacing him.\n\nThat second goal from Munir has effectively sewn up this game in Barcelona's favour. Now they seem happy to sit on it and keep possession - and even with 10 men they're managing that with ease. Claudio Bravo still left looking for anything to do...\n\nTwo debutants combine to double the lead as the second half begins! Ivan Rakitic play in Munir with a brilliantly crafted chip and the youngster confidently fires home with a brilliant improvised finish. That should be this win sorted for Barca.\n\nTop quality all-round.\n\nBarcelona might have a new manager in Luis Enrique but this is very much the same from them.\n\n80% possession, Messi on the scoresheet and looking shaky at the back - just like old times!\n\nWhat a last five minutes of that half - Lionel Messi opened the scoring as he made the pressure pay but then Javier Mascherano was sent off for bringing down Garry Rodrigues when he was through on goal on Elche's only real attack.\n\nAside from that, the half has seen\u00a0Munir El Haddadi and Andres Iniesta hit the bar - and the real star of the show: a black cat pitch invader.\n\nThat changed quickly - Garry Rodrigues somehow finds himself through on goal for the so-far blunt Elche attack and Javier Mascherano drags him down as the last man.\n\nReferee Fernando Teixeira Vitienes had no hesitation in bringing out the red even as Mascherano pleaded his innocence. Professional foul - correct decision and Barca are down to 10.\n\nThat should make this game a bit more interesting.\n\nThe defenders can only stand and stare as Barcelona's little maestro produces a perfect first touch and runs past three of them before confidently finishing\n\nFive years in a row he has scored on the opening night of La Liga. Easy does it.\n\nMessi plays a brilliant slide-rule ball through to Munir. He's in a great position to shoot but perhaps the 18-year-old's inexperience showed as the tried to square it to a non-existent team-mate.\n\nFrom a clever Ivan Rakitic free-kick Dani Alves, sporting a questionable new bob haircut, comes from deep to strike at goal. It goes just wide with Tyton stranded.\n\n79% possession for Barca so far.\n\nBarca are getting closer and closer. Messi links up with the Spanish playmaker again and he crashes a left-footed strike from range against Tyton's crossbar.\n\nBeautiful play from the Barcelona star men. They exchange successive one-twos which bring them to the edge of the area including a couple of backheels but are eventually crowded out by the packed Elche defence.\n\nThis kid is good... Debutant Munir al Habbadi latches on to Andres Iniesta's pass, turns and instinctively shoots from just inside the area, but he hits the woodwork. A brilliant effort. Barca are getting closer.\n\nWhat's that? You want more pictures of the cat? Oh, ok then.\n\nThe Catalans are already camped deep in Elche territory tonight - and Lionel Messi is dropping deep to find the gaps that could open up their defence. Eventually they make it into the Barca half a couple of times but they're heavily outnumbered. Claudio Bravo hasn't even touched the ball yet.\n\nLuis Enrique is taking charge of his first game having previously played for Barca and after working with their youth academy.\n\nThe Nou Camp crowd sing his name.\n\nMessi is playing provider here and he picks out Dani Alves' run to play him in on goal. Elche's new keeper Tyton comes out to deny him but brings down the Brazilian. Difficult decision made easier by the fact Alves was offside.\n\nBarcelona have started strong - they look sharp and we've barely seen a misplaced pass so far.\n\nWith almost 10 minutes on the clock Lionel Messi goes scampering down the right wing and a brilliant turn takes him into the box before he eventually opts for a cross that doesn't quite meet the intended target.\n\nAfter the cat is eventually caught the ball can come into play. Barca keeping possession early on - although is that really news?\n\nThere's a black cat doing the rounds of the Nou Camp pitch. Play has to stop and the cat keeps running on and off - stewards in pursuit but they can't get it into their clutches...\n\nBut then a man in a fluorescent jacket comes to the rescue, but ends up dropping the cat off the pitch. So, so strange. I hope Barcelona aren't superstitious....\n\nHere we go. Elche kick us off.\n\nElche just about survived in La Liga last season following promotion from the Segunda division, eventually finishing just above the relegation zone in 16th.\n\nThis summer saw them lose their best player, Carlos Sanchez - now of Aston Villa - but they have made some additions including the earlier-mentioned Pasalic and former Juventus winger Milos Krasic - although he misses out tonight.\n\nThe club have big financial problems and are fifth favourites to go down this season. It could be a long night for Elche and their manager Fran Escriba.\n\nChelsea loanee Mario Pasalic starts for the visitors in midfield tonight in a understandably defence-focused 5-4-1 formation.\n\nWant to know more about Pasalic?

That player punched him in the side of the head, causing serious injury. While the cause of death has yet to be officially confirmed, Portillo never woke up from the resulting coma.\n\nThe secret risk of youth sports\n\nI've been in adult coed games where I feared for somebody's well being off the field. It was scary (and annoying, quite frankly, because it disrupted play while we all sat around watching someone get calmed down). But, as a lifetime athlete, I'm also kind of familiar with that aggression, granted on a much smaller scale, and I see the seeds of it in my children.\n\nIf genetics are anything, my husband and I have blessed our daughters with natural athletic ability and cursed them with an unnatural intensity and self-criticism. My husband threw racquets. I hyperventilated and sulked and once even stomped off a field yelling obscenities at my coach.\n\nWe watch our older daughter, Avina, who is 3 1/2, and joke about how she's doomed to be like us, but really, we're both concerned. Like any kid, Avina wants us to watch every chass\u00e9, every somersault, and if she can't do something, she almost immediately yells \"I can't do it!\" then throws whatever's in her hand and marches off. So young, and already her above average coordination is mixing poorly with a need for perfection.\n\n5 anger management tips for children\n\nThat's what Dr. Patrick Cohn, a youth sports psychologist in Orlando and founder of youthsportspsychology.com, calls it -- perfectionism. It's that self-criticism so common to athletes that can intensify in the teen years, because, well, they're adolescents. \"Perfectionists have a difficult time with making mistakes,\" Cohn said, when asked how to cultivate resilience on the sports field. \"We help these athletes manage their high expectations about performance and to react better to mistakes.\n\n\"Many children link their self-esteem with their performance. If they perform badly, their self-esteem suffers. It's important for parents to help their kids separate their self-worth from achievement in sports.\"\n\nCohn specializes in how mental attitudes shape performance and works with professional teams, athletes, parents, even corporations, on how to develop that attitude.\n\nHow to prevent sports injuries in kids\n\nNot only is this strength, this ability to cope with adversity, with challenge, an excellent life skill, it's also, as we see more and more these days, about safety. A competitive sport inherently involves some aggression; how do we know when a kid is crossing a line? How do we prevent or police the transition from competitive to dangerously aggressive?\n\n\"Sports itself requires athletes to assert themselves against an opponent, such as to obtain possession of a soccer ball or basketball,\" Cohn said. \"But athletes cross the line between assertive behavior and aggressive behavior when they break the rules in sports or intentionally try to harm other athletes, coaches, or referees.\"\n\nAnd this is more likely to happen when athletes become frustrated or angry. So, if we teach them to deal with frustration and anger, we can help prevent violence, of any scale, on the field.\n\nMy outbursts were minimal when I was younger, when my father was an active part of my game experience. He was known for how level headed and fair he was. And this rubbed off on all of us. Granted, later, when I became more independent and my parents were less involved, my temper flared. Maybe I was missing other role models. I'm sure I was tying my self-worth to my game. Certainly, when I had a supportive coach, I acted out less.\n\nParents are key to cultivating this capability, but, Cohn says, everybody is responsible for modeling as well as actively making a healthy attitude happen -- parents, coaches, even the leagues, which should set up bylaws, outlining acceptable behavior, and then enforce those rules. \"And the parents can't be afraid to report bullying or bad behavior. Athletes, as well, should look out for their teammates,\" Cohn notes.\n\nWhy I told my daughter she sucks at sports\n\nAccording to his daughter, Johana Portillo, her father was a ref because he was passionate about the game. \"He loved soccer,\" she told CNN. \"We just never thought this was going to happen. He loved what he did and it was his passion.\"\n\nAs an adult, when I was somehow completely free of social and personal pressure, I would often sit in my car after a soccer game, removing my muddy cleats, reflecting on how truly joyous it is to play just for the love of it. I want my children to feel that from the start, free from violent disruptions, both internal and external.\n\nBecause there is no role model more powerful than a parent, and no better way to take back our ball fields than raising kids with composure, here are more tools for parents on how to raise real athletes, on and off the field.\n\nTools for Parents\n\nDr. Cohn created a pre- and post-game checklist to help parents encourage balance and positivity in their child's athletic experience. Some of the to-dos will be more challenging than others. In general, the message is: stay positive, calm, neutral, and leave the game on the field. This will help your child keep his sense of self-worth separate from performance and help him trust his coach and the officials.\n\n5 Pre-game To-Dos\n\n1. Help your child or teen feel confident about today's game or competition. If you discuss the game, remember to be positive about your athlete's past experiences and successes. Don't point out mistakes or losses. Stay away from the subject of avoiding mistakes from previous games. Say, \"Have fun! I know you'll do your best!\"\n\n2. Leave the coaching to the coach. Show that you support the coach's decisions. Don't talk about how you'd like the coach to manage the team or how you disagree with some of his decisions. This will undermine your athletes' confidence and trust. They need to enter the game trusting their coaches.\n\n3. Keep your emotions in check. Be a good role model for composure. If you show that you're jittery, nervous, or worried about the game or competition, your child or teen will likely be affected by these feelings.\n\n4. Be a good fan. Be composed on the sidelines before the game. Demonstrate your trust in the coach, the players, and the referees. Don't express your feelings about who should play, or how the coach should play the kids, or how you view a particular ref. Be only positive and supportive. Find ways to support the team\u2014by bringing water or snacks, for example, or serving as scorekeeper if the team needs a parent to do this.\n\n5. Avoid prolonged discussions about your athlete's technique or mechanics before the game. Practice time is over. Just before a game, athletes need to believe in what they've learned and trust in their abilities. If you focus too much on mechanics and technique, they may freeze up. It may be difficult for them to play freely and with trust in their abilities. Avoid saying things like, \"Remember the Square Drill and be sure to kick with the side of your foot instead of your toe.\" Say instead, \"Go for it! Have a blast.\"\n\n5 Post-Game To-Dos\n\n1. Start by making two positive comments about your son or daughter's game. Pick out two simple areas you can complement your son or daughter about. For example, \"You really hit the ball great off the tee today and made a great comeback after a slow start.\" You are more likely to get your player's attention by starting with a couple of positive comments.\n\n2. Ask your player, \"What are two things you did well today?\" Discuss these first no matter how well or poorly your child played.\n\n3. Be mindful of the subtle rewards or punishment you may unknowingly or knowingly give your player after the game. For example, showing excitement and enthusiasm (for good play) is a reward for your child. Withdrawing attention or being silent (after a bad performance) is a form of punishment for your child.\n\n4. Avoid dwelling on numbers, scores, or position in the event after the game or performance. Discuss statistics only if necessary to make a point. Perfectionists are too obsessed about statistics already, which does not help them maintain a process focus during performance.\n\n5. Leave sports on the playing field! Avoid discussing the game at home and help your child shift gears into other roles in life. Do not go over the play by play unless your child asks. Focus on developing balance in life rather than being 24/7 sports.\n\nGet 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!!\n\nCopyright 2011 The Parenting Group. All rights reserved.

And the d\u00e9tente that usually follows these territorial disputes is muddied by the leadership change in Beijing expected next month.\n\n\"This is where it's becoming dangerous,\" said Alan DuPont, defense expert at the University of New South Wales. \"No incoming Chinese leader can be perceived to be weak on territorial claims.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Japan Coast Guard said two Chinese surveillance ships entered its territorial waters, while 10 other Chinese ships patrolled nearby. Meanwhile, China announced Sunday it was postponing planned celebrations later this month marking the 40th anniversary of normalization of relations between Beijing and Tokyo.\n\nThe bellicose rhetoric also charts the rise of an assertive China and a sea change in the forces shaping Pacific politics that are writ small in the battle over the uninhabited island chain, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan.\n\n\"China's feeling more confident both in its position and in its right to the area both legally and politically,\" Mark Valencia, a fellow at the National Asia Research Program and expert on the South China Sea dispute. \"And nationalism in China has gained strength and influencing the government.\"\n\nRising tensions in China waters\n\nThe East China Sea isn't the only flashpoint for territorial tensions among China and its neighbors. The South China Sea is dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls, many of which have competing claims from China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Just like the friction with Japan, there have been increasing incidents of tension between China and its South China Sea neighbors over island claims.\n\nIn 2011, Vietnam claimed that Chinese patrol boats cut cables from PetroVietnam boats during oil and gas surveys in disputed waters. Beijing said that Vietnamese vessels have been illegally surveying in Chinese waters and harassing Chinese fishing boats. The same year Philippines also reported boats cutting cables of a survey ship and threatening to ram its boats.\n\n\"A lot of this wouldn't be happening if China wasn't becoming more assertive and being more confident, and that's one important issue why all these issues are becoming more salient,\" DuPont said.\n\nThe difference in the East China Sea is the collective might of China and Japan, the second and third largest economies in the world, respectively. \"When you have two major nation states involved, it's more dangerous than the (South China Sea),\" DuPont said.\n\nA nationalist wave\n\nThe often violent protests that broke out in dozens of Chinese cities -- from Guangzhou in the south to Qingdao in the north -- came to a head after the Japanese government bought the disputed islands from the Japanese family that have privately owned the islands on September 11 for 2.05 billion yen (US$26.2 million).\n\nDozens of Japanese factories and businesses temporarily shut their doors in the wake of the violence as angry crowds overturned Japanese brand cars and looted Japanese stores in some areas. The island dispute, which traces back centuries, have reached diplomatic boiling points in 1996, 2005 and most recently in 2010, when a Chinese boat allegedly rammed a Japanese patrol boat, resulting in the arrest of the Chinese sailors.\n\n\"I don't think anyone thought the Chinese reaction would have been as strong as it was, and I don't think anyone expected the level of violence that we saw, especially looking at past incidents,\" said James Manicom, an expert on maritime disputes at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Waterloo, Canada.\n\nThe \"nationalization\" of the islands infuriated Chinese, although analysts say Tokyo's move was an effort to wrest the issue away from Japanese nationalists, led by Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara who launched an online appeal to buy the islands. Donations poured in, prompting a sharp rebuke from China and forcing the Japanese government to wade into the dispute with its own offer for the contested land.\n\n\"If you're interested in stability, the Japanese government is better than owning the islands than a group of nationalists, because who knows how they might raise tensions,\" Manicom said. \"(Prime Minister) Noda's calculation is, this is going to explode in the short-run, in the long run it's better.\"\n\nEconomic interests\n\nAlthough nationalistic ardor on both sides of the dispute have brought the current situation to a boil, national interest in the territory can be traced to a 1969 United Nations geological survey that contains this tantalizing line: \"A high probability exists that the continental shelf between Taiwan and Japan may be one of the most prolific oil reserves in the world.\"\n\nAlso under its South China Sea lie potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil. A Chinese estimate suggests as much as 213 billion barrels of oil lie untapped in the South China Sea - which, if true, would make it the largest oil reserves outside of Saudi Arabia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nAt the heart of all these island disputes in China Seas is a term of international maritime law known as \"Exclusive Economic Zone,\" where nations are allowed sole rights to fish and develop resources within 200 nautical miles of a country's shores. That has created interest in nation's grabbing uninhabited islands - often little more than rocky atolls - to thereby extend their zone.\n\n\"The area is starting to look a little bit like Alaska, at first looked worthless, now may not be worthless,\" Valencia said. \"The East China Sea is virtually all continental shelf, which means it's all relatively easy digging except in typhoon season.\"\n\nBut the likelihood the areas will be developed dwindles as the political storm brews between China and Japan. If this fracas follows past contretemps, the two sides will cool for a few months before rapprochement from high-level officials on both sides. But with the leadership change coming in China, and leadership elections imminent in Japan's two major parties, the likelihood is tensions will remain high. \"No one wants to be perceived as soft on China,\" Manicom said.\n\nMeanwhile, as historic enmities over Japan's war past inflame tensions in China, public sentiment is changing in Japan toward China.\n\n\"The result is the average Japanese person views China with more suspicion than the past,\" Manicom said. \"You can now be anti-China in Japan and not be conservative, which is a development that I think took Beijing by surprise.\""}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 14, 16, 19, 15, 5, 6, 10, 4, 12], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Captain Smriti Trehan refused to switch scheduled flight to later direct flight from Mumbai.\nShe ignored orders and turned up to airport for original job.\nSources said pyaz kachoris was successfully delivered to Captain Trehan.", "text": "An Air India pilot faces suspension after ignoring last-minute orders to change flights because she had arranged to pick up her favourite snack along her original route.\n\nCaptain Smriti Trehan refused to switch her scheduled Mumbai-Jodhpur-Delhi flight to a later direct flight between Mumbai and Delhi, according to reports.\n\nThe pilot wanted to fly via Jodhpur, as she had arranged for the city's famous onion kachoris to be delivered to the airport.\n\nPeckish: Captain Smriti Trehan reportedly refused to switch her scheduled Air India Mumbai-Jodhpur-Delhi flight to a later direct flight between Mumbai and Delhi, as she had planned to stop in Jodhpur to collect food\n\nTrehan, from Delhi, was staying \nat a Mumbai hotel when she was ordered to change flights, according to the Times of India.\n\nHer original flight had been scheduled for 12pm but she was asked to switch to a 2pm flight.\n\nShe ignored the orders and turned up to the airport for her original job, informing operators that she did not intend to change her plans.\n\nHer refusal caused chaos among Air India staff as they scrambled to find a replacement pilot, delaying the Mumbai-Delhi flight by an hour.\n\nSources said that the pyaz kachoris was successfully delivered to Captain Trehan at Jodhpur \nairport and she took off for Delhi without delay.\n\nSenior officials were reportedly made aware of the incident, immediately ordering an inquiry."}, {"annotators_ids": [19, 5, 13, 16, 14, 15, 6, 10, 4, 12], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Ronald Read frequented a coffee shop at Friendly's in Vermont for breakfast.\nRead was in the Army during World War II with his brother, George J.

Those pollutants are released into air through smoke, and into ground and water supplies through the slag waste, a byproduct of a refinery's production process that often includes elements like arsenic.\n\nDespite rainy weather, the crowd swelled Monday to thousands as angry residents took to the streets, chanting slogans and unfurling banners that read \"protect Shifang's environment and give us back our beautiful home,\" according to photos and videos posted online by protesters.\n\nAfter the mayor's promise to suspend construction failed to reassure the crowd, some demonstrators hurled water bottles and potted plants at police and overturned official vehicles, forcing officers to disperse the crowd with tear gas and stun grenades, the government said.\n\nBut Chinese residents on the country's social media sites appear to have overwhelmingly supported protesters and their cause, and condemned the local government for its crackdown. Many have also applauded Shifang business owners who posted \"no police allowed\" signs outside their restaurants and stores after Monday's violent clashes.\n\nIn a subtle sign of its dissatisfaction over local authorities' handling of the situation, the government in Beijing has so far remained largely silent, continuing to allow messages and images of the protest to be uploaded online.\n\nExperts say the Shifang episode has again highlighted the rising danger in China's behind-closed-doors environmental evaluation process.\n\n\"This is a typical case in which the lack of public participation in the decision-making process leads to greater confusion and conflicts between government and the general public,\" said Ma Jun, a prominent environmentalist and head of the Beijing-based Institute of Public Environmental Affairs.\n\n\"In this case, the ideal solution is to re-evaluate the whole project to set an example for the future.\"\n\n\"Another problem is that there's no guarantee our existing regulations can be faithfully implemented,\" he added. \"We've had similar cases before and now apparently the public awareness has grown significantly.\"\n\nThe protest in Shifang is the latest example of China's urban residents -- long considered the main beneficiaries of the government's economic reforms -- banding together, often via the Internet, to defend their rights.\n\nLast August, a large protest prompted authorities in the northeastern port city of Dalian to shut down a controversial chemical plant that produced paraxylene (PX), an allegedly carcinogenic compound used in the production of polyester films and fabrics.\n\nIn 2008, residents in Shanghai worried about radiation risks took to the streets to protest the construction of a high-speed rail line using the magnetic levitation technology, forcing the government to suspend the project indefinitely. And in 2007, residents in the southeastern city of Xiamen marched against a local PX plant, which eventually moved out of the city."}, {"annotators_ids": [12, 13, 16, 5, 10, 14, 19, 15, 4, 6], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Catherine MacLean spent three weeks in isolation at a clinic so she could get a bone marrow transplant.\nHer mother had to wear a surgical mask if she slept there.\nThe camp Catherine attended is staffed by cabin counselors.\nNicole Kucine is a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.", "text": "(CNN) -- In 1996, when she was 4 years old, Catherine MacLean learned she had aplastic anemia. For seven years, she lived from hospital visit to hospital visit, one transfusion to the next. It wasn't until the summer of 2002 that her world suddenly included what was possible beyond the walls of her illness. She was 11.\n\nFor many of the years in between, her disease controlled her life -- aplastic anemia is a type of bone marrow failure that made it impossible to produce enough red blood cells to support her body.\n\nIn 2001, Catherine spent three weeks in isolation at a clinic so that she could get a bone marrow transplant. All visitors had to scrub down before entering the room, and her mother had to wear a surgical mask if she slept there.\n\nWhen she went back to school, Catherine had kept up academically, but the social environment at the school made for a difficult transition.\n\n\"I was definitely clearly very aware that I was different from the other kids in my class, in a lot of ways -- in terms of maturity, in terms of risk taking,\" Catherine told CNN.\n\n\"There's just this gap in experience, because I've just done things and been to places that they just haven't.\"\n\nTo help her meet other kids who understood, Catherine's doctors encouraged her to go to a special summer camp for seriously ill children. The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps were started by actor Paul Newman \"to acknowledge luck; the chance of it, the benevolence of it in my life, and the brutality of it in the lives of others, made especially savage for children because they may not be allowed the good fortune of a lifetime to correct it.\"\n\nThe camp Catherine attended, in Ashford, Connecticut, is staffed by cabin counselors, doctors and nurses, and it prides itself on giving kids a place where they will feel \"safe, respected and loved.\"\n\nFor these kids, suffering from diseases such as hemophilia, sickle cell anemia and cancer, it is a chance to see past the walls of the hospital to what the world might be like if a diagnosis didn't control their every move, if clinics and hospital rooms weren't like second homes.\n\nCEO Jimmy Canton has been with the camp since it started in 1988. He describes it as a place where children are encouraged to look beyond what they thought was possible: \"They've been told over and over again what they can't do. And camp reminds them that there's an enormous amount of things that they can do.\"\n\nNicole Kucine is a pediatric hematologist and oncologist who's getting more training at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and has volunteered at the camp for four years. Outside of the summer, she works closely with many sick children in hospitals and clinics; at the camp, she sees ill children in an entirely different light.\n\nWhat she sees -- children dancing around dining halls, inviting and insisting that she join in -- is invigorating.\n\n\"Seeing kids kind of ignore their disease was amazing. That they have to take medicine when they eat their meals wasn't a big deal. They could be normal,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"Normal\" was not something Catherine was that familiar with before camp. The start of camp coincided with the one-year anniversary of her transplant, and her doctors were just starting to use the word \"cure.\"\n\nAt the camp, Catherine was embraced by young counselors, eager to get to know her. Many of the counselors were in college, which helped her envision what had for so long been an intangible future.\n\n\"My sort of vision of my life had always been very narrowed, and it was always very much a day-by-day. It was like in a week, I have to get another blood transfusion, and in a couple months, we're gonna be changing my medication, and in a couple months, we're gonna transplant,\" she told CNN.\n\nThe experience allowed Catherine to think, \"There's things out there. I can set long-terms goals now. I can have long-term goals. There's things that I'm going to be able to do.\"\n\nThe friends from her camp still provide support and understanding today, when \"normal\" life can get complicated. Explaining the intricacies of her illness could be daunting to a college freshman trying to make new friends. But her camp friends can commiserate over routine checkups and test results without requiring any explanation.\n\nThe camp also changes the way children interact with authority figures. In hospitals, there are always many caretakers who often do things to sick children that are uncomfortable, like drawing blood or giving them medications.\n\nWith events like \"Silly Olympics,\" the camp puts kids back in the driver's seat. Correctly answered trivia questions win campers the right to fling a spoonful of pudding in their counselor's face, or spray a counselor with a Super Soaker, or perhaps make lemonade mix in a counselor's mouth.\n\n\"Silly Olympics is, here's this authority figure, but you're allowed to throw pudding at them, you're allowed to strike back, you're allowed to kind of take control of the situation in a way that a lot of these kids get control over their bodies and their lives just completely taken away from them,\" Catherine said.\n\n\"In the hospital, you're a patient, that's all you are; in a lot of ways, you are your illness. And here, you're getting up on stage and you're a singer or you're a wood shop craftsman or you're a fisherman, you get to try different things, and so you can take back a sense of 'I like to fish, I'm good at this, I discovered this talent,' \" she told CNN.\n\nThis year, as Catherine finishes up her first year of college, she looks forward to many possibilities, such as medical research and graduate school. But she says the camp has also opened up her eyes to the social side of medicine, and she is considering going into public health or pursuing a job that supports patients.\n\nBut for now, she is just excited about her summer job. She'll be going back to the camp that changed her life, but this time as a counselor.\n\nFor thousands of very sick children around the world, summer camp is not just a place to escape parents and make new friends."}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 5, 10, 15, 16, 19, 4, 6, 12, 14], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "The fibreglass cylinder floated into the garden of a traffic policeman.\nThe tube could be part of a spaceship fallen to Earth or an ICBM.\nIt washed up in a Siberian village.\nIt quoted Alexei Yaskin as saying cylinder was probably relic of Soviet space industry.", "text": "Siberian villagers were left stunned when a flood washed what appears to be a piece of inter-continental ballistic missile onto their doorsteps.\n\nThe fibreglass cylinder floated into the garden of a traffic policeman after floodwaters inundated the village of Malougrenyevo in Altai, Western Siberia.\n\nAfter villagers took photos and circulated them online, speculation grew that the tube could be part of a spaceship fallen to Earth, or even an ICBM that had been decomissioned and buried nearby.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSurprise: The cylinder which washed up in a Siberian village, panicking locals who feared it might be radioactive\n\nAs fears began to mount that it might be radioactive, a general consensus emerged that it must be dangerous and that authorities would move quickly to hush up the blunder.\n\nBut RT, the Russia's state-backed international news network, reported that the truth was somewhat more mundane.\n\nIt quoted Alexei Yaskin, professor of aero-space engineering at Biisk Technology University, as saying the cylinder was indeed probably a relic of Russia's space industry, albeit one that never made it off the planet.\n\n'That this is an empty body of a rocket engine, presumably left from the Soviet times on the territory of the Biysk chemical plant,' he said.\n\n'As it's an empty body with no fuel in it, it poses neither public nor technical danger.\n\n'Such tanks may be handy in households as water collecting and storage containers, or - if dug into the ground - can be used as a sewerage facility.'\n\nHis explanation was backed by a local \ngovernment official, who said that a family living close to \nMalougrenyevo had had been using it to store water.\n\nThe\n chemical plant in Biysk, Altai's second largest city, had previously \nused such tanks as containers for rocket fuel, RT reported.\n\nAfter demand\n dropped with the fall of the Soviet Union, there were plenty of tanks \nleft spare.\n\nOfficials say it is a relic of the space industry, but was left spare when local enterprises shut down in the 1990s\n\nNikolay Dochilov, deputy chief of the Federal Scientific and Manufacturing Centre in Altai told Itar-Tass the rocket part was made of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer.\n\nHe said: 'It is a legacy of of an enterprise closed at the beginning of the 1990s that specialised in filling the shells with fuel.\n\n'We did had an enterprise that specialised in filling those missiles, which were produced at Dnepropetrovsk in Ukraine.

There he took a serious drug overdose, and four days later he was found dead, a plastic bag at his side.\n\nIn the weeks before he took his life, the 18-year-old suggested to family, friends and doctors that the famous comedian had taken advantage of him. He told one nurse: \u2018I felt dirty, used, belittled and humiliated.\u2019\n\nAfter he was found dead in his\u00a0 hospital room, local police officers alerted Scotland Yard to \u2018suggestions that Benjamin may have been the victim of a serious sexual assault\u2019.\n\nBut police never questioned the celebrity and he has not given evidence at Ben\u2019s inquest, where the coroner agreed his identity should be protected.\n\nThe claims emerged after the ongoing inquest heard from an independent expert that Ben did not receive the required standard of care at the hospital, and that staff had been kept in the dark about the seriousness of his condition.\n\nHowever, the jury has also heard evidence from several witnesses that Ben\u2019s troubles worsened after he met the older man, soon after moving to London from Cornwall.\n\nHe had been a star pupil at the Fashion Retail Academy founded by billionaire tycoon Sir Philip Green, the inquest in Truro heard last week.\n\nIn his first year he was chosen to attend a lunch with Sir Philip, and in April 2010 he put a question to David Cameron when he visited the London college during the General Election campaign.\n\nBen\u2019s parents Sharon and Steve Cowburn, who run a chain of nursery schools in Cornwall, believed\u00a0 he had settled in well after starting the course in September 2009.\n\n\u2018It was around this time I became aware that Ben had met a celebrity in a pub when he was out with friends,\u2019 his mother told the inquest jury.\n\nStar student: Ben Cowburn, circled bottom right, asked David Cameron a question during a 2010 election campaign visit to his college\n\n\u2018He had asked Ben to do some styling work for him. Steve and I were quite cautious about it and were warning Ben. He told me that this man already had a stylist and that he couldn\u2019t pay Ben but that he would buy him presents.\u2019\n\nShe said they had discovered Ben\u2019s new friend had featured in a gay magazine. \u2018He told me that the celebrity had got a job for Ben to be his stylist at the Edinburgh Festival.\u2019\n\nHis twin sister Sophia told how Ben had tried a cocktail of drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy.\n\nHe also spoke of the many clothes Mr X had bought him, as well as a designer Burberry bag.\n\nBen was said to have told his sister: \u2018I\u2019m milking him for a change instead of him milking me.\u2019\n\nNurse David Taylor said Ben had \u2018had a sexual relationship with a man who was on the television. He thought he had been groomed. He felt embarrassed, ashamed and used but never said he was raped or abused. It was consensual.\u2019\n\nBut the teenager reportedly said: \u2018He took advantage of me. He bought me nice things, spent money on me, took me to places \u2013\u00a0 private parties.\u2019\n\nAccording to police, Ben told nurse Joseph Wilson-May that the comedian had \u2018made a move on\u00a0 him\u2019 in the back of a cab but the teenager \u2018shrugged it off\u2019.\n\nDC David Gadsby from the Metropolitan Police told the inquest: \u2018One evening Ben went to a party at this man\u2019s house. There was a lot of drugs and alcohol there.\n\n\u2018At about 4am, Ben wanted to leave but a cab was too expensive. The man offered a room and Ben went to sleep. When he woke up this man was lying in bed next to him.\u2019\n\nHe performed a sex act on the man \u2013 but Ben was said to have claimed to the nurse that he \u2018wasn\u2019t gay but felt pressured into doing things\u2019.\n\nBereaved: Sharon and Steve Cowburn, Ben's parents, are pictured arriving at the inquest a week ago\n\nDC Gadsby said Ben had told the nurse about a private party at a separate address. \u2018At some point during this party a group of men got Ben to strip and began playing with him. Another guest told them to stop.\u2019\n\nAnother nurse told how Ben claimed to have been raped. But once he had used the word he never returned to the subject.\n\nHe had also asked his elder half-sister Laura: \u2018What do you think he is doing? Grooming me?\u2019\n\nThe policeman told the inquest: \u2018Laura said that Ben led her to believe he had been raped.\u2019\n\nBut police decided there was \u2018no conclusive evidence\u2019 that Ben was physically forced into sex and so had no grounds for questioning Mr X.\n\nThe star\u2019s identity has been protected under an informal agreement between Cornwall Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon and barristers representing Ben\u2019s family and the NHS.\n\nThey agreed that because the comedian had never been questioned, arrested or cautioned it was unfair to name him. The Mail on Sunday is aware of his identity.\n\nJurors were shown Facebook messages between the student and Mr X but they appeared to be friendly. Ben had written to him in June: \u2018Pleeeeaaaaze come and meet me xxxxx.\u2019\n\nWhen Ben returned to the family home in Truro in summer 2010 after completing his first year at college, he revealed that his planned trip to Edinburgh with the celebrity had been cancelled, but gave no reasons.\n\nHis mother then noticed a \u2018real change\u2019 in Ben\u2019s behaviour with \u2018hard partying, late nights and outbursts of anger\u2019.\n\nWithin days of returning to college after the summer, Ben was found by police threatening to jump from a railway bridge. He was talked down, taken to a mental health hospital for assessment and later driven back to his family.\n\nDuring the autumn of 2010 his mental state rapidly deteriorated. He made a series of suicide attempts, threatening to jump from a multi-storey car park, lying across a railway track and trying to throw himself in front of cars on the A30.\n\nIn October he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act to Longreach Hospital near Redruth, later staying as an informal patient.\n\nBen, by then 18, began to hint about troubling sexual experiences in\u00a0 London, and tried further attempts at self-harm and suicide. He was found dead in his bedroom on December 20, with a plastic bag close by.\n\nDr Alin Mascas, a psychiatrist at Longreach, said: \u2018We considered that he had been exposed to an event of traumatic intensity, possibly sexual assault in London.

There, he checks himself, removes his sunglasses, pops them in his top pocket and dives into the ocean nine meters below him.\n\n\"It's the most stupid thing I've ever done,\" is  Alex Thomson's frank assessment of his stunt.\n\n\"It wasn't safe at all,\" adds the yachtsman more used to solo circumnavigating the globe. \"Only looking back do I really appreciate how dangerous it actually was.\"\n\nThe stunt was carried out without a harness, just a water resistant suit, although the risk was reduced thanks to the work of a stunt co-ordinator and two days of preparation on the water.\n\nFor Thomson's daredevil performance to succeed he also needed a wind speed of exactly 18 to 20 knots and for the boat to be traveling at 10 knots (a little under 20 kph).\n\nThe 37-year-old and his team began their search for the perfect wind speed in Palma, Mallorca, but were forced to switch to Tarifa in southern Spain because conditions weren't right before eventually shifting to Cadiz where the stunt was eventually performed.\n\n\"At the end of the first day, I had to sit down on shore and calm down,\" says Thomson.\n\n\"I was appreciating perhaps it wasn't safe at all, and there were some hairy moments when we were practicing. I remember one time I was halfway up when the boat suddenly tacked and I was just left hanging from the mast.\n\n\"Obviously falling from that height from the mast onto the deck isn't advisable,\" he quips. \"The ramifications wouldn't have been great.\"\n\nOn the day itself, with stunning skies above, the stunt went pretty much perfectly, which had a lot to do with the man driving the boat, Ross Daniel.\n\n\"His was the harder, more nerve wracking job as he had to keep the boat just right,\" says Thomson. \"Ross works for me and he's a good mate so obviously he was conscious he didn't want things to go wrong.\n\n\"I'm not sure if he was relieved come the end of it but he was certainly happy man with how it went.\"\n\nAs for Thomson's starring role in the escapade, he's conscious that he came very close to really hurting himself.\n\n\"Now the top of a mast isn't really designed for a man to dive off but I went for it and it held up,\" says the yachtsman.\n\n\"As for the dive itself, I slightly over-egged. There was some quite impressive editing work on that as I landed head first very close to my back.\n\n\"It was quite close to a back belly flop and, while I wouldn't have killed myself, I certainly would have had some nasty internal injuries.\n\n\"Diving wise, I'd always wanted to dive but wasn't sure until I got to the top whether I'd have the guts to do it.\n\n\"I'd been up a 10-meter board at a pool in training but never dived off it. So this was a first and, once I was up there, I sort of thought I might as well go for it.\"\n\nAs he pondered that stomach-churning dive, Thomson says he felt surprisingly calm.\n\n\"As a sailor I'm used to hoisting myself up the mast and you get well versed at reading the wind and the waves so I was quite aware if there was suddenly going to be a change in the boat's course,\" he explains.\n\nThere wasn't, he duly hit the water and quickly returned to the surface to the relief and cheers of his team.\n\nEven now, Thomson, who has a penchant for being something of a daredevil, is not entirely sure why he performed the stunt.\n\n\"I did a keel walk a while ago and we did a video for that, which got over two million people watching which I was flabbergasted by,\" he admits.\n\n\"So we got talking about doing something else and this seemed a bit of fun really.\n\n\"I'd taken to running up the mast -- although not necessarily to the top -- for a while, mostly when entertaining people on the boat to, say, take pictures of them on the deck.\n\n\"So, going the whole way up and jumping off seemed a good idea.\n\n\"It's a bit like the Vendee Globe (the race to circumnavigate the globe). You sort of agree to it not thinking it will necessarily happen, and then suddenly the day comes for it.\"\n\nHaving done a keel walk two years ago and now a mast walk, Thomson is at a loss to consider what might complete a hat-trick of sailing stunts.\n\n\"That was the same after the keel walk. I'd never planned to follow that or do something like this, it just happened.

She was \nringing doorbells, spraying shaving cream, throwing eggs, and toilet \npapering homes in her elite gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe last house she happened upon was that of Michael and his brother Tommy Skakel.\n\nShe left no later than 11pm, to walk the 150 yards or so to her neighboring house. But she never got there.\n\nInstead, her body was found beneath a tree in her back yard.\n\nShe had been bludgeoned with a 6 iron golf club so powerfully that the shaft had shattered.\n\nMartha had been impaled in the neck with a shard from the shattered club.\n\nHer pants had been removed, along with her underwear, but there were no signs of sexual assault.\n\nTommy\nand Michael were initially suspects in the case after it was discovered\nthat the murder weapon had belonged to their late mother.\n\nLong\nbelieved to have been bungled from the start, many believed police gave\nthe rich family special treatment in the case and ignored, or failed to\neven look for, incriminating evidence.\n\nScene: Another court evidence photo shows the rear of the Skakel home in their elite gated Greenwich, Connecticut community. Martha Moxley's home was just 150 yards away\n\nThe case was considered a tough one for prosecutors because of the age of the crime, no forensic evidence and other challenges. But Skakel was convicted after a trial that focused on testimony that he confessed or made incriminating statements over the years.\n\nA year after Skakel was found guilty, a former classmate implicated two friends in the killing. A judge later rejected an appeal, ruling the claim was not credible.\n\nIn the latest ruling, Bishop said Skakel's defense should have focused more on Thomas. He also said\n\nSherman failed to locate a witness who backed up Skakel's alibi that he was at his cousin's house the night of the murder and failed to find a man who challenged the claim by the star witness that Skakel confessed.\n\nThe Skakels cooperated with the investigation until 1976, then abruptly stopped.\n\nYears of continued speculation about Tommy, Michael, and a range of other suspects followed.\n\nBooks\nwere published on the subject, including one by Mark Fuhrman of OJ \nSimpson trial infamy, but it wasn't until 1999 that the case got any \nmore traction.\n\nClues?

Her fun, frisky outlook on life inevitably colors my own. It's hard to be mad at that face, even when it has destroyed shoes, leather-bound books and countless dog beds. Thanks to Lulu, I take more time to enjoy the little things in life, such as cuddle time or endless shades of blue on display during our morning walks. Pets can teach us so many things, but only if we pay attention.\n\nHere are a few lasting lessons from pets that made news in 2011.\n\n1. A dog's loyalty has no match\n\nA massive earthquake caused a tsunami last March that eviscerated communities in Japan. Struggling to find signs of life in the ravaged community of Sendai, one camera crew discovered a dog carefully guarding its injured four-legged companion. That heartbreaking scene generated millions of views on YouTube and serves as a lasting reminder of one dog's loyalty \u2014 even in the midst of chaos. According to the Nippon Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Mei Chan, the Brittany spaniel that stood vigil over her injured friend, has been reunited with her guardian. The search for Lee Chan, the injured dog, continues.\n\n2. Pets don't decide how much they will eat; people do\n\nLulu may gain a few extra pounds during winter months, but I try to keep her weight in check. She's much easier to handle at bath time when there's less junk in the trunk. Unfortunately, plenty of pets and people seem to be losing their battle of the bulge. A study by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention found that more than half of the cats and dogs in this country are overweight or obese. Weight gain can increase the risk for diabetes, a pricey and preventable health condition.\n\nDr. Jennifer Monroe of Eagles Landing Veterinary Hospital in Georgia offers simple advice to correct this growing pet health issue: \"We have a responsibility to [pets] as their caretakers to make sure they stay healthy. The best way to make sure they stay healthy is to keep their weight in a reasonable range.\"\n\nGrab a leash or some interactive toys. Pronto!\n\nMNN: 7 incredibly loyal dogs\n\n3. Love conquers all\n\nFor every happy reunion, countless military families cope with devastating loss. A Labrador retriever named Hawkeye placed that pain into razor-sharp focus during the funeral for his owner. Navy SEAL Jon Tumilson was one of 38 killed on Aug. 6 when a rocket-propelled grenade took out a U.S. Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan. During the funeral, Hawkeye approached Tumilson's casket and remained at his side until the end.\n\n4. Breed-specific legislation breeds lawsuits\n\nPit bulls have received plenty of bad press, leading several U.S. cities and some states to ban the breed. Pit bull lovers argue that breed-specific legislation fails to punish negligent owners. Enforcing such bans also can be costly for taxpayers. The most recent example involves a pit bull named Snickers and his owner, disabled veteran Jim Sak. Although Snickers is certified with the National Service Animal Registry, Saks was forced to place his pit bull in a kennel due to a ban on the breed in his new hometown of Aurelia, Iowa.\n\nSaks and the Animal Farm Foundation filed a lawsuit, arguing that the Americans with Disabilities act does not prohibit pit bulls from being service dogs. A federal judge ruled in favor of the Saks, and now Snickers is going home.\n\n5. The skies aren't quite so friendly for pets as cargo\n\nDogs, cats, snakes and hamsters take to the friendly skies on a regular basis. But horror stories like that of Jack, the JFK cat that never made his flight from New York to Los Angeles, still make me nervous about pets flying as cargo.\n\nJack escaped when a clerk placed his kennel on another kennel and it fell, opening on impact. Over the next few months, concerned pet lovers took to Facebook with messages about the missing feline. Although Jack was found 61 days later, he was euthanized because of malnourishment and dehydration, which made him prone to severe infection and organ dysfunction.\n\nIf long-distance pet travel is in your immediate future, take steps to reduce the risk of loss or injury.

Be prepared\n\nIn May of 2011, residents of Joplin, Missouri, faced one of the deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history. More than 120 people died and 1,000 more were injured. News reports that followed indicate that some residents may have ignored initial warnings.\n\nIf you live in an area that's known for weather emergencies, act as soon as you hear a warning, says Toni McNulty, team lead for animals in disaster with HumanityRoad.org (@Redcrossdog on Twitter.) \"When pets sense urgency, they hide and you lose valuable time trying to find them,\" she says.\n\nPrepare an emergency plan that includes your pets. Keep food, health records, leashes, collars and crates ready at a moment's notice, along with emergency contacts. When disaster strikes, you must be your own first responder.\n\n7. Your pets may outlive you\n\nNews that designer Alexander McQueen committed suicide shocked the world. In July 2011, BBC reported that the troubled artist had left $82,000 to care for his dogs. It served as a painful reminder that pets require care long after we are gone.\n\nPet owners have several options for legally establishing long-term care, including a contract, will or pet trust. Several states also offer general guidelines for pet trusts. But the first and most important step involves identifying friends or family members who are up for the task of caring for your pets.\n\nMNN: How to include pets in your estate plans\n\n\"Nobody likes surprises,\" says Atlanta attorney Steve Dubner, adding that your top choice isn't required to accept the responsibility. It also helps to create an emergency contact list that includes friends or neighbors who can quickly reach your pets. Carry a copy in your wallet or purse, just in case.\n\n8. You're never too old to learn a few new tricks\n\nPet adoptions tend to spike during the holiday season. If you have a furry new addition to your home, start things off on the right foot with obedience training, regardless of the pet's age.\n\n\"Everyone needs to be working with the dog,\" says Kate Jackson of Jabula Dog Academy in Decatur, Georgia, who encourages the entire family to participate in training efforts. \"At home, the dog will only respond to who puts work into it.\"\n\nAsk your vet to recommend obedience classes in your area or seek referrals for a reputable trainer. Starting early is the key to a long and happy relationship with your pet.\n\nMNN: Hiker and dog rescued from L.A. cliffside\n\n9. Seize the day, every day!\n\nFor my Lulu, a simple tennis ball leads to hours of unspeakable joy. Too bad we all can't be that happy-go-lucky. Bookmark this link to the Happiest dogs on YouTube and watch it any time you need a mental lift. Then grab a tennis ball and seize a few minutes of playtime with your pet.\n\nSure, the emails and to-do list will still be there. But they may just be a little more tolerable once you've rolled around on the floor with reckless abandon.\n\n10. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\n\nThe American Pet Products Manufacturing Association estimated that pet owners spent more than $14 billion on veterinary care in 2011. A large portion of that bill goes toward treating preventable issues such as arthritis, diabetes and heart disease.\n\nTo reduce the chance of unnecessary illness or injury, it pays to keep your pet mentally and physically stimulated. Dr. Arhonda Johnson, owner of The Ark Animal Hospital in Atlanta, offers this pearl of wisdom for a healthy 2012: \"The best way to keep pets out of the veterinary clinic is proper nutrition and exercise, just like with people. Feed them good, nutritious food and walk them regularly.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2011 Mother Nature Network"}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 16, 19, 5, 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 4], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "One million men have chosen to work part-time over two years.\nOut of the 8.2million part-time workers in the UK, 5.6million have chosen to work shorter hours.\nThere are now 1.02million men in the UK who have decided to reduce their hours compared to 4.58million women.\nHe is one of the most senior leaders at the group yet works three days a week.", "text": "One million men are now actively choosing to work part-time as they become more involved in childcare or retire gradually.\n\nOfficial figures show there has been a stark 14 per cent rise in the number of men opting to work part-time in the last two years.\n\nThis compares to a 4 per cent rise in women choosing part-time work over the same period, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nOne million men have chosen to work part-time as they become more involved in childcare or are retiring gradually\n\nThere are now 1.02million men in the UK who have opted to work reduced hours, compared to 4.58million women \u2013 who more commonly work part-time to care for children or family.\n\nIt follows a sharp rise in the number of stay-at-home fathers, with the latest figures showing a 6 per cent annual rise, compared to a 28 per cent fall in the number of stay-at-home mothers.\n\nMen now make up one in 10 parents who care for their children or family full-time.\n\nBut recruitment experts said the rise in part-time male workers also signalled an increase in pre-tirement \u2013 a trend where older gradually reduce their hours rather than suddenly retiring.\n\nOut of the 8.2million part-time workers in the UK, 5.6million have chosen to work shorter hours, 1.35million cannot find full-time work, 200,000 are ill or disabled and 1.02million are students.\n\nKaren Mattison, of Timewise \u2013 a company which helps people find flexible work \u2013 said: \u2018In the past, discussions about flexible work have tended to focus more on women \u2013 and particularly mothers \u2013 rather than on men.\n\n\u2018The challenge we face, is debunking the myth of the outdated perception of what flexible working means and for who.\n\n\u2018Just as there is \u2018no one reason\u2019 for needing flexibility, there is no one \u2018gender\u2019 who needs it either.\n\n\u2018Out of the 5.6 million people now choosing to work part time in the UK, the number of men now doing this has now hit the one million mark.\n\n\u2018This is the future of work as we know it, and it is refreshing.

The BBC has been heavily criticised in the 166-page report, called 'The Future of the BBC'\n\nTo be presented in Parliament this afternoon, it recommends that:\n\nLast night John Whittingdale, who chairs the committee, said: \u2018When an organisation is in receipt of nearly \u00a34billion of public money, very big questions have to be asked about how that money is provided and spent, and how that organisation is governed and made accountable.\n\n\u2018In the short term, there appears to be no realistic alternative to the licence fee, but that model is becoming harder and harder to justify and sustain.\u2019\n\nThe Tory MP said the corporation made a valuable contribution to public life, but that it needed to examine its size and scope, and cut certain services.\n\nCritical: Conservative MP John Whittingdale said that while tje corporation made a valuable contribution to public life, it needed to examine its size and scope, and cut certain services\n\nHe added: \u2018The BBC has tried for too long to be all things to all people \u2013 with the rapid changes in communication and media technology and markets and changing audience needs and behaviours, this no longer works.\n\n'It should tailor its output to what it does best, and not stray into areas that can and should be left to commercial providers to do well.\n\nBRITAIN risks losing the \u2018global information war\u2019 as the BBC World Service is out-gunned by foreign state-backed broadcasters.\n\nMPs said the corporation\u2019s long-established foreign arm could struggle to compete against other networks because of changes to its structure and funding.\n\n\u2018At a time when countries like Russia and China are increasing their investment in media, including services aimed at the UK, we believe that the World Service has an increasingly important role in what is a global information war,\u2019 their report said. \u2018Given its new funding and oversight arrangements, we fear the importance of the World Service could be diminished.\u2019\n\nUntil last April, the World Service received a separate grant from the Foreign Office \u2013 but the foreign arm is now funded by the licence fee.\n\n\u2018It is pointless and wasteful having an organisation receiving that kind of public funding competing with \u2013 and potentially crowding out \u2013 other providers.\u2019\n\nAnyone watching programmes when they are broadcast requires a television licence, regardless of whether they use a TV or a computer.\n\nHowever, there is no legal requirement to pay for watching the same programmes online on catch-up services such as iPlayer after they have aired.\n\nThe MPs call for urgent changes that would force people to pay for the iPlayer service, for example by blocking non-subscribers.\n\nThe corporation must \u2018prepare itself\u2019 for the licence fee to be abolished altogether in the 2020s, the report says.\n\nThe levy should be replaced by a flat-rate charge, payable by all households.\n\nA spokesman for the BBC said: \u2018This report confirms the importance of the BBC in national life and recommends maintaining and modernising the licence fee, something we have said is necessary.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re grateful to the committee for endorsing our record for efficiency and maintaining the quality of programmes and services, and note

a year to run \u2013 a third of the cost of running the total BBC estate \u2013 yet it houses just a fifth of its staff.\n\nTHE BBC should own up to its mistakes and end a culture where bosses try to blame others for their errors, the report claims.\n\nIt says the Corporation is \u2018beset by problems of its own making\u2019, but instead of dealing with them openly, its senior managers point the finger at other people.\n\n\u2018[There have been] notable failures and underperformance in certain areas which the BBC has not always been ready to acknowledge until well after the fact,\u2019 it said.\n\nThe BBC and the BBC Trust should also stop attempting to bury information that could cast the Corporation in a negative light, it added.\n\n\u2018In our view, the BBC Trust and the BBC Executive have often tended to highlight favourable performance figures over the less favourable...The BBC should aim to be a better, more transparent, self-critic.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Corporation has written off nearly \u00a3100million on a Digital Media Initiative technology project, so badly mismanaged that director general Tony Hall decided to scrap it three years in.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, also squandered public funds.\n\nIn 2007, it bought the travel publisher Lonely Planet in a deal worth \u00a3130million.\n\nHowever, it failed to make a success of the business, and sold it off at an \u00a380 million loss six years later.\n\nThe Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said: \u2018The Digital Media Initiative was found to have been mismanaged on a large scale and was dropped having delivered few benefits at a loss of \u00a3100million.\n\n\u2018BBC Worldwide\u2019s move into risky commercial activities, not in line with the BBC\u2019s core public service remit, led to a similar loss.\u2019\n\nIt added: \u2018Given the financial problems in the current charter period which dented the BBC\u2019s reputation, the NAO must now be given unrestricted access to the BBC if it is to provide assurance that the Corporation is spending money wisely and trading fairly.\u2019\n\nMPs also slammed the BBC over the \u00a3369million in pay-offs it has handed to departing staff.\n\nA BBC spokesman said: \u2018The NAO already has extensive access to the BBC\u2019s affairs and recently produced a report commending the savings we have made on

And that was a disastrous strategy.\n\n'What the party should have done in this election is take on UKIP.\n\n'But the Labour party needs to have a broader appeal.

Well, I am afraid, really, the general election campaign started at the start of this campaign, and we have not done as well as we should have done.'\n\nHe attacked the Labour leadership's refusal to grant the public a referendum on Europe and slammed Mr Miliband for his blundering TV performace this week in which he failed to know how much he spent on his shopping.\n\n'The centrepiece of our campaign has been the cost of living, and yet Ed didn\u2019t know his own cost of living when he went into it, he didn\u2019t know how much he was spending on shopping.\n\n'Really, people around him should have said when David Cameron had been attacked as a posh boy not knowing the price of milk that we should not fall into that trap. We should know the price of milk and bread. That sort of thing is unforgivably unprofessional.'\n\nThe Labour leader said the party was making gains in key battleground seats - including in London and the south East. But he faced criticism from within his own party for not doing better\n\nProfessor John Curtice said the public did not seem to see Labour as a alternative Government.\n\nHe said: 'When it comes to local elections, we have quite high expectations of what oppositions should achieve.\n\n'We basically say, if a party looks as though it is potentially regarded as an alternative government, it should be doing very well in local elections, even better than you would expect to do in a general election in 12 months' time.\n\n'The truth is, by that test at least, Labour have not done well enough.\n\n'Most of the seats that were being up for grabs yesterday were last fought over on the same day as the 2010 general election.\n\n'And if you compare Labour's performance vote-for-vote with 2010, the advance is just 3 percentage points - 3 per cent on what was the day in which Labour recorded its second worst result.\n\n'And if you actually compare these results with the position two years ago, which we can also compare most of these places with, Labour's vote is clearly well down, something like nine points.\n\n'When you talk more deeply to people, they don\u2019t really find an empathy or sympathy with Ed'\n\n'So the truth is, modest progress, Labour not even doing as well as they were able to do earlier in this parliament, and thereby again reinforcing the doubts that have always been there that at the end of the day it is not entirely clear that the British electorate regard Labour as a clear alternative.'\n\nFormer Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain yesterday warned the party was losing working class votes \u2013 and warned Mr Miliband to adopt a more \u2018robust\u2019 approach to Ukip.\n\n\u2018The problem is that there is a seriously alienated \u2013 mostly white working class, often male \u2013 vote out there that was traditionally Labour\u2019s,\u2019 he said.\n\nOne senior Labour figure told The Times: \u2018The truth is that Miliband looks weird, sounds weird, is weird.\u2019\n\nLabour shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna attempted to play down the emergence of Ukip, saying support for the party represented \u2018discontent with the entire political system\u2019. But he added: \u2018Undoubtedly we\u2019re in an era of four party politics.\n\nFormer minister David Lammy said the party should have done better in places such as Swindon, conceding that voters were 'swallowing' Ukip's message on immigration and Europe.\n\nBut Labour election boss Douglas Alexander insisted Labour could win the general election based on the results coming in overnight from key battleground seats. The party has seized control in Hammersmith and Fulham, previously a flagship Tory authority, and is expecting positive results in Merton and Croydon.\n\n'Ed Miliband is not on course to win the next election', claimed Tory MPJackie Doyle-Price after the results started trickling through this morning. Many Labour MPs are concerned that Mr Miliband is seen as too 'weird' to win\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: 'I think there is not just a whole group of people who feel left behind by the economy but locked out of politics.\n\n'There is a deep anger and alienation there and the votes that we have seen for Ukip overnight are in part a reflection of that reality.\n\n'The challenge is how does a party like the Labour party seek to respond?

The numbers of people living in poverty is likely to drop sharply in East and South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, with sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind.\n\nKojm said, \"economic growth, the rise of the global middle class, greater educational obtainment and better health care mean -- for the first time in human history -- the majority of the world's population will no longer be impoverished.\"\n\nBut perhaps the biggest question mark in the report is the Middle East.\n\nThe region \"will be a very different place\" in 2030, the authors conclude. \"But the possibilities run a wide gamut from fragile growth and development to chronic instability and potential regional conflicts.\"\n\nThe youth boom that has driven the Arab Spring revolts will give way to an aging population, while shifts in energy consumption may force oil-rich Middle Eastern economies to find new sources of income.\n\nThe growth of middle classes will increase demand for political and social change, but that could be a mixed blessing: \"Historically, the rise of middle classes has led to populism and dictatorships as well as pressures for greater democracy,\" the authors noted.\n\nMeanwhile, that global growth \"disguises growing pressures on the middle class in Western economies,\" including international competition for higher-skilled jobs.\n\nThe growing middle class will also increase demand for water and food by more than 35% over the next couple of decades the report indicates. Advancements in key technologies such as genetically modified crops, precision agriculture and water irrigation techniques should for the most part prevent scarcity.\n\nAn increase in the earning power, education and political clout of women \"will be a key driver of success for many countries,\" with gender gaps closing fastest in East Asia and Latin America, the report found.\n\nAnd India is likely to be in the same position in 2030 that China is today, it concludes.\n\n\"India's rate of economic growth is likely to rise while China's slows,\" the authors found. China's 8%-10% growth \"will probably be a distant memory by 2030,\" it notes.

What on earth did that little six-year-old\nboy do to deserve that?\u2019\n\nAnother local resident said: \u2018I think\nthey had only just moved in to the house in the past couple of weeks. \nThe only thing I noticed which was odd, was that when I got up in the \nmiddle of the night, their downstairs lights were always on, even at \n4am.\u2019\n\nYesterday, the curtains of the little \nboy\u2019s upstairs bedroom were drawn, with just a little England football \nmini-kit visible on the window.\n\nThe downstairs curtains were also drawn as forensic teams and detectives searched the property.\n\nA white Peugeot van, believed to belong to the 34-year-old man, was parked outside the address.\n\nSorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons."}, {"annotators_ids": [23, 19, 21, 4, 5, 6, 15, 10, 12, 14], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Prime Minister called on households across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe No vote is running at 54 per cent while Yes is on 46 per cent.\nAn Opinium poll for The Observer put No on 53 and Yes on 47.\n43 per cent of English and Welsh think the move was a 'panic measure'.", "text": "David Cameron today issues a passionate call for households around the UK to fly the Scottish flag to show their backing for a No vote in Thursday\u2019s historic referendum.\n\nWith just four days to go until the crunch vote \u2013 and with the polls neck and neck \u2013 the Prime Minister called on families across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to put the Saltire in their windows in support of the Union.\n\nMr Cameron\u2019s rallying cry came as a new poll published yesterday put the No vote eight points ahead. According to Survation, in a poll commissioned by the Union camp, the No vote is running at 54 per cent while Yes is on 46 per cent.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nGetting passionate: With just four days until the crunch vote, David Cameron is calling for people to show public support for the union\n\nHowever, former Chancellor Alistair Darling, the leader of the pro-union campaign, reminded nervous supporters that more than 500,000 people who were eligible to cast their ballot had not yet made up their minds.\n\nMr Darling said: \u2018The situation is fluid. If we vote to leave by one vote there is no going back. We will have bought a one-way ticket.\u2019\n\nHis warning seemed prescient last night as Downing Street was shaken by an ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph which put Yes on 54 per cent and No on 46 \u2013 though polling experts warned that the small survey size of 700 meant that it was vulnerable to a \u2018sampling error\u2019.\n\nAn Opinium poll for The Observer put No on 53 and Yes on 47.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Cameron said the vote was \u2018going down to the wire\u2019 and he hoped a final lovebombing from around the UK could persuade the undecideds to vote No.\n\nDescribing the contest as \u2018nerve-racking\u2019, he said: \u2018There are lots of things [people could do] whether it is using social media, tweeting and blogging your support for the UK; whether it is phoning a friend, talking to relations or work colleagues who live in Scotland and have a vote.\n\nHe wants families across England, Wales and Northern Ireland to put the Saltire in their windows\n\n\u2018Or whether it is more visual demonstrations \u2013 hoisting the Saltire over buildings, putting a flag in your window \u2013 there are any number of things people should do.\u2019\n\nHowever, as Mr Cameron was urging support for the union, a Mail On Sunday poll of voters south of the border was pointing to a growing backlash against the idea of granting extra powers to the Scots to persuade them to vote No.\n\nThe \u2018devo-max\u2019 cross-party deal, including scope for Scotland to set its own taxes, was hastily brokered by Gordon Brown last week after a poll put the Yes camp ahead. The new poll found that 43 per cent of English and Welsh think the move was a \u2018panic measure\u2019, while 61 per cent object to the fact that Scotland already receives the highest level of per-head public spending in the UK. Just 12 per cent think that Westminster should bail out an independent Scotland if it runs into financial trouble.\n\nThe knife-edge final days of the campaign have contributed to party turmoil for both Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband. One senior Tory MP confided to this newspaper that a \u2018clear majority\u2019 of Conservative MPs expected Mr Cameron to resign if the Scots vote for separation, and that his leadership could still be in trouble if the pro-union camp prevails on Thursday.\n\nThe MP, who holds an executive position on the party\u2019s powerful backbench 1922 Committee, said the rushed agreement to give the Scots greater devolution even if they voted to stay had annoyed rank and file MPs.\n\nHe said: \u2018More than 50 per cent of the Parliamentary party think the PM should go if he loses. But there is also an iceberg contingent who will be restless if we win, because we have promised too much \u2013 and let Gordon Brown lead the way.\u2019 He explained: \u2018A few MPs are very visibly complaining, but an awful lot more are grumbling out of sight.\u2019\n\nMr Miliband is facing internal ructions over Mr Brown\u2019s promise of enhanced devolution powers, with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls complaining during a tumultuous Shadow Cabinet meeting that he was \u2018out of the loop\u2019 on the offer \u2013 and warned it could prevent a future Labour Government from ever passing a Westminster Budget if Scottish MPs were barred from voting.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday poll highlights how much is at stake for the Labour leader. Survation found that across the UK, Labour\u2019s support is running at 35 per cent \u2013 a lead of four per cent over the Conservatives \u2013 enough to give Mr Milband a Commons majority of 44 if a General Election was held tomorrow.\n\nIf Scotland was excluded, Labour would be one point ahead, on 34 per cent, and Mr Miliband\u2019s majority would be slashed to just nine seats.\n\nDuring his interview, Mr Cameron insisted that the devo max plan in the aftermath of a No vote would be the final \u2018resting place\u2019 of devolution, and it would put an end to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe PM said: \u2018The UK is not indifferent, you hear lots of concerns about what it means for them, what it means for our standing, what the consequences would be. More than anything else from the rest of the UK you get arguments of passion rather than arguments about detail, which I hope shows everybody knows how much we care about the UK.\n\n'Scratch an Englishman and you don\u2019t have to go very deep until you find an absolute passionate Briton and someone who believes in the UK.\u2019\n\nThe Mail on Sunday poll also found that the referendum campaign has stimulated support for an English Parliament, with 47 per cent backing the measure and just nine per cent opposed.\n\nIt also showed strong support for a guarded border between England and Scotland if Mr Salmond signed up to the Schengen agreement, the EU\u2019s open-borders programme.\n\nThe Prime Minister will try to push home the No camp\u2019s advantage tomorrow with a major speech in which he is expected to pay tribute to Scotland as \u2018a proud, strong, successful nation\u2019 and hail \u2018the patriotic vision of a strong Scottish nation allied to the rest of the UK.\u2019\n\nResponding to the eight-point poll lead for the No camp, Mr Salmond said: \u2018I think it is wrong because I think there is huge movement \u2013 and the movement is towards Yes.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had over the last week panic, heeby-jeebies from Downing Street. The Yes campaign is going to win this campaign, and win it well.\u2019\n\nBalls: Brown\u2019s transfer of tax-raising powers would be a nightmare\n\nTaxing question: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls\n\nEd Balls has raised fears that handing massive new tax-raising powers to Scotland \u2013 as suggested by Gordon Brown \u2013 could mean big trouble for a future Labour government.\n\nThe Shadow Chancellor privately warned that Scottish Labour MPs might have to be banned from voting on budgets for England and Wales if Edinburgh gained control of income tax North of the border.And that could leave a Labour government at Westminster unable to pass finance legislation for the rest of the UK.\n\nMr Balls\u2019s concerns came amid predictions that Labour leader Ed Miliband will be \u2018fatally wounded\u2019 if Labour supporters in Scotland vote \u2018yes\u2019 on Thursday.\n\nA rapid timetable to hand Scotland sweeping new powers over income tax rates and finance in the event of a \u2018no\u2019 vote was unveiled by ex-Prime Minister Mr Brown last week in a surprise bid to reduce the likelihood of an independent Scotland.\n\nBut at a behind-closed-doors meeting of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet held the following day, Mr Balls warned of grave implications for an incoming Labour government if Mr Brown\u2019s plan went ahead. Mr Balls said: \u2018If we give away the whole tax-raising power to the Scottish Parliament, how can Scottish Labour MPs then vote for a Labour Budget in England?\u2019\n\nCurrently, 40 of the 59 Scottish MPs are Labour, with pollsters predicting Mr Miliband will need a sizeable Scottish contingent at Westminster to form a government with a workable Commons majority after the General Election next May. A witness at the meeting said: \u2018It was clear what Balls was saying.\n\n\u2018He was wondering out loud how we would get Budgets passed at Westminster without Scottish Labour votes. It\u2019d be a nightmare.\u2019\n\nMr Miliband had no answer to his Shadow Chancellor\u2019s concerns, according to reports.\n\nLast night, senior Labour figures said there was mounting anger over Mr Miliband\u2019s \u2018failure\u2019 to energise the vital Scottish Labour vote to come out against independence.\n\nOne said: \u2018If Miliband\u2019s been unable to deliver Labour voters in Scotland \u2013 and the figures point to that \u2013 it\u2019s another nail in the coffin for the party as a whole.\n\n\u2018There would be a major debate about the leadership of our party.\u2019"}, {"annotators_ids": [23, 6, 15, 4, 5, 10, 12, 14, 19, 21], "scores": [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "England have unveiled their new home kit ahead of the autumn internationals.\nThe red rose has been moved to the centre of the shirts for the first time ever, directly above the title sponsor O2.\nThe ' Test ' jersey is available for a hefty \u00a590.\nA ' Pro ' version, which can be bought for the cheaper price of \u00a555.\nIn a to England's heritage, the St George's Cross and the red rose, Lancaster's men will wear a crimson shirt and navy blue shorts.\nThe crimson shirt will be used for the First time against Samoa on November 22..", "text": "England have unveiled their new kit ahead of the autumn internationals - with the home design to be worn for the first time when Stuart Lancaster's men host the All Blacks on November 8.\n\nThe red rose has been moved to the centre of the shirts for the first time ever, directly above the title sponsor O2, and the 'Test' jersey is available for a hefty \u00a390.

Should citizens trust them after all they have done against freedom?'\n\nSome twitter users wondered if profit not concerns over user privacy had motivated this open letter.\n\nGovernments are now facing a groundswell of opinion calling for reforms and limits to surveillance.\n\nTrevor Timm, an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the New York Times the strength of public outrage over government prying into their private data was now too big an issue to ignore for the internet companies.\n\nHe said: 'It\u2019s now in their business and economic interest to protect their users\u2019 privacy and to aggressively push for changes.\n\n'The N.S.A. mass-surveillance programs exist for a simple reason: cooperation with the tech and telecom companies.

'That's my biggest dream and it always has been. He came across as a very kind man, a very good man, and I trusted him.'\n\nThe pair, who had planned to co-parent the children, decided to use in-vitro fertilization with anonymous donor eggs for the pregnancy.

He has temporary custody\n\nWhen she found out earlier this year that, after two rounds of IVF, she was pregnant with twins, 'I was absolutely thrilled,' Close said. 'I always wanted twins.'\n\nBut feelings of joy were quickly replaced with betrayal when she gave birth to a boy and a girl in July - and McMurrey told her he was taking the children.\n\n'The social worker came to me and said we \nhad a surrogate situation,' she said. '[The worker] claimed I was a surrogate for him and his\ndomestic partner that I didn't even know he had.'\n\nHe became so enraged when he saw Close breastfeeding the children in hospital, he took out a restraining order against her, she said.\n\nBetrayal: After the birth, Marvin McMurrey (left) told Close he was gay and the babies would be brought up by him and his partner, Phong Nguyen (right). The children are currently staying with Nguyen\n\nBattle: Close said that even though she used donor eggs to get pregnant there was never a surrogate contract\n\nCindy Close's case is complicated as a doctor advised her to use donor eggs due to her age, so she is not the children's biological mother.\n\nMarvin McMarrey claims she was a surrogate, but typically, a contract must be agreed and the mother and father are spelled out if this is the case.\n\nHowever, attorneys said Texas law does not exclude other arrangements for surrogates, which is an issue the courts may take up here.\n\nIn normal surrogate cases, the intended mother's eggs are used inside a different woman. Even though the intended mother does not carry the children, she is legally the 'mother' due to an agreement. In this case, an anonymous donor was used and the child would have no legal mother, as is required.\n\nAn issue that could also work \nagainst McMurrey, who wants to bring up the children with his gay partner, is that the intended parents have to be married for a\nsurrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state.\n\nTraditional surrogacy - where parents use a surrogate woman's eggs and body to carry a child - is not recognised in Texas.\n\nMcMurrey filed a lawsuit against \nClose in August, demanding he be named as the father as she was simply a\nsurrogate and had no rights.\n\nHe has temporary custody of the children, and they are now living with McMurrey's partner, Phong Nguyen - even though the father does not live there.\n\nClose said she is only allowed to see \nher children for two hours a day on Monday to Friday, and claims the \ncouple has placed cameras in the room to watch her as she holds her \nbabies.\n\n'I only ever wanted to be a mom and... after giving me my dream, he's taking that away,' she said, breaking down in tears.\n\nThe courts will now determine what rights Close has as she struggles to define in legal terms what it means to be a mother.\n\n'We've alleged he duped Cindy into have \nher children on the basis on him attempting to have her declared a \nsurrogate once they were born,' her attorney, Grady Reiff, said.\n\nHe\nexplained that, in Texas, the mother does not need to prove she is the \nparent but McMurrey must prove Close was a surrogate. They never signed a\ncontract or agreement, he said.\n\n'This was not a surrogacy, so it never \noccurred to me that I would ever need a written agreement,' Close told the Houston Chronicle. 'If anything, I thought he would lose \ninterest because I didn't expect him to be a very involved father.'\n\nReiff\nadded: 'It's our position that a woman who gives\nbirth is the mother, unless there is a [surrogate] agreement.' If \nMcMurrey had his way, the children would have no legal 'mother'.\n\nTaking a stand: Attorney Grady Reiff said Cindy was duped and McMurrey must prove she was a surrogate\n\nIn surrogate cases, the intended \nmother's eggs are used and, while she does not carry the child, she is \nthe 'mother' because of the agreement.\n\nIn Texas, it's not the mother's burden to prove she is the parent, Reiff, said, so the onus is now on McMurrey to prove Close was a surrogate.\n\nAnother issue that could work \nagainst McMurrey is that the intended parents have to be married for a\nsurrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas.

In Charleston County, Sanford's home base but the Democrats' best hope as well, he narrowly edged out Colbert Busch.\n\nColbert Busch won absentee ballots, but it wasn't nearly enough to carry her to victory.\n\nSanford: Primary win was 'a big referendum' on comeback effort\n\n\"Turnout was very large for a special election -- roughly a quarter of the 18-plus population voted, more than 140,000 votes total,\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, who analyzed the vote. \"That seems to have helped Sanford.  Low turnout would have meant a lot of Republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and wouldn't vote for a Democrat. High turnout turns that around: Plenty of Republicans who had misgivings about Sanford came out to vote anyway.\"\n\nSanford's oldest son Marshall and his now-fianc\u00e9e Maria Belen Chapur were standing beside the candidate at his victory celebration.\n\n\"She flew a continent to be here last night. Whether I won or lost, she wanted to be here,\" Sanford said Wednesday mornign on CNN's \"Starting Point.\" \"We certainly appreciate her willing to do so, and I think as folks get to know her, I think they're going to love her.\"\n\nSanford was in his second term as governor in 2009 when he disappeared from public view for several days. At the time his staff claimed he'd been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was actually in Argentina, seeing Chapur, with whom he was having an affair.\n\nThe episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Sanford and wife Jenny were divorced in 2010. He finished his second term as governor in January 2011, after being censured and fined tens of thousands of dollars for ethics violations, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity.\n\nBut he came back, beating out 15 other candidates earlier this year to win the Republican nomination in the race for the vacant House seat. From the start, Sanford was very open about the affair on the campaign trail and made it the subject of his first TV ad.\n\nAnd even with all his political baggage, he was considered the favorite in the race until last month, when court documents revealed his ex-wife had filed complaints against Sanford for trespassing on her property.\n\nSanford told CNN that he didn't want to leave his sons home alone while their mother was away. He's scheduled for a court appearance two days after the election.\n\nNot long after the trespassing story broke, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced it was pulling out of the race and national Democratic groups announced they were throwing more money into the contest.\n\nAnd National Democratic groups jumped in. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and independent pro-Democrat House Majority PAC combined dished out nearly $1 million to defeat Sanford.\n\nThe two groups, as well as Colbert Busch, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch brought up Sanford's 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress.\n\n\"When we talk about fiscal spending and we talk about protecting the taxpayers, it doesn't mean you take that money we saved and leave the country for a personal purpose,\" she said sternly, looking directly at her opponent on stage.\n\nIn South Carolina politics, two very different campaign styles\n\nAnd her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for using \"tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character.\"\n\nThe DCCC and House Majority PAC have also spotlighted the affair in their final ads.\n\n\"I used to be for Mark Sanford, but not any more. He skipped town to be with his mistress on Father's Day. Sanford even asked his wife for permission to have the affair,\" said Mt. Pleasant Republican voter Jennifer Stark in the House Majority PAC commercial.\n\nBut over the past month, another woman also entered the campaign spotlight: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nSanford and his campaign repeatedly tried to tie Colbert Busch to Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections.\n\nOpinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace\n\n\"I've fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country. Maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest is bigger than them or me, it's about two different visions of how we restore America and reign in Washington spending,\" Sanford said, looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide last week.\n\nTwo weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate.\n\nSanford also repeatedly brought up the money that national Democratic groups have poured into the South Carolina race.\n\n\"What it says is, whose voice do you carry when you go to Washington D.C.?\" he said in the debate with Colbert Busch, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that national Democratic groups have spent on the race.\n\nColbert Busch, responding to the Sanford criticism, sought to distance herself from Washington and from national Democrats.\n\n\"No one tells me what to do except the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. So a victory for Elizabeth Colbert Busch is a victory for the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District,\" she told CNN Monday, adding that two-thirds of her contributions have come from within the Palmetto State.\n\nWhile Sanford touted his fiscal conservative record, Colbert Bush campaigned as an independent centrist who would buck President Barack Obama. In her CNN interview, she highlighted where she doesn't see eye to eye with the president.\n\n\"I respectfully disagree with his budget,\" she said, adding that \"we need to vote to repair\" the president's health care law.\n\nEven though they didn't support Sanford, the NRCC congratulated him Tuesday night, and said the results could prove troublesome for House Democrats in 2014.\n\n\"Democrats spent more than $1 million trying to elect a candidate who was backed by the Democrat machine, but at the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch,\" Rep. Greg Walden, NRCC chairman, said in a statement.\n\nBut national Democrats see a silver lining in Colbert Busch's defeat.\n\n\"House Republicans' outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face. Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until Election Day,\" Rep. Steve Israel, DCCC chairman, said in a statement. \"In this deep red Republican district that Mitt Romney won by 18 points, the fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates.\"\n\nSanford has a woman problem\n\nThe congressional seat became vacant when Rep.

For others it is the first step on a road that will lead to adoption and a new life.\n\nWhile traditional adoption hotspots are becoming less attractive -- Russia has banned Americans from adopting children, and it can take years to navigate China's adoption bureaucracy -- Uganda is seen as a quick and easy alternative for prospective parents.\n\nOpinion: Russia's adoption ban harms kids\n\nIn Uganda, the adoption process can take just a few months to complete. The country is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, a treaty which provides a blueprint for safe international adoptions.\n\nMany of the children adopted from Uganda are given a better shot at life overseas - certainly in material terms -- but the speed and ease of the process has many observers worried.\n\nFreda Luzinda worked at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, for two years processing adoption visas. She is now the Uganda national director of the A Child's Voice, an NGO promoting child rights and welfare.\n\nShe says that many birth parents in Uganda don't fully understand what adoption actually means and that there is no word for 'adoption' in the local Luganda language.\n\n\"I can say that about 60% of the birth parents that I spoke to didn't understand adoption,\" said Luzinda.\n\nMany birth parents do not understand that adoption is permanent. They believe they may get their children back later. These misconceptions are part of the problem, but not the only problem.\n\nThe rise in Ugandan adoptions over the past few years has created a growing number of orphanages and adoption agencies to meet the demand.\n\n\"When I first started processing visas at the embassy... there were probably between seven and 10 orphanages that were putting children up for adoption. And the numbers grew, and they grew, and they grew. By the time I finished, and this was two years later, we had a count, and we were dealing with about 100 orphanages.\" said Luzinda.\n\nThe explosive growth of the adoption industry in Uganda has fueled fears that children are being exploited for profit and that the best interests of the child is not paramount.\n\n\"Orphan creation does happen a lot in Uganda, and this is done by adoption facilitators who will go and scout the slums, find vulnerable families and talk them into giving up their children,\" said Luzinda.\n\nIn the 12 years from 1999-2010 there were just 311 adoptions from Uganda to the U.S. In 2011 alone -- the last year for which State Department numbers are available -- 207 children were adopted to the U.S. from Uganda.\n\nBrothers Zach, age about 4 and Philip, about a year older, have found a loving family in the U.S. but their early life was typical of Uganda's estimated 2.4 million orphans.\n\nBoth boys were found abandoned in different places in Kampala, both were left in conspicuous places and both were found by police officers.\n\nNow Zach and Philip have a new life in the U.S., both are in school and having loving new parents.\n\nIn 2008, they were adopted by Lisa and Tague Harding of Minnesota through the Amani Baby Cottage, one of the respected, religiously-affiliated orphanages.\n\n\"There is always a tragedy at the beginning of a story that makes adoption a necessary step,\" said Lisa.\n\nAs their children grew up and left home, the Hardings saw an opportunity to provide a stable home for children who would otherwise grow up in poverty.\n\nInternet reveals secrets of 'closed' adoptions, report says\n\nThe Hardings became interested in international adoption after traveling to Uganda with a church group.\n\n\"I love that in our faith, adoption is part of the story -- that Baby Moses was adopted and there was Samuel in the Bible that was adopted and baby Jesus. Joseph was not his birth father.\" said Lisa.\n\nDanyne Randolph Bharj, director of the Amani Baby Cottage, understands the fears concerning the exploitation of children, but says that given the options for Ugandan children, in many cases adoption is the best solution.\n\n\"I don't think it's right to say the West is the way to save Uganda at all. I don't think that's the answer. But I think if there's people in the West that can give these children a family when no one else can, I do think it's more important,\" said Bharj.\n\nBut James Kabogoza, assistant commissioner of Children's Affairs for the Ugandan Government, feels that Ugandan children should stay in Uganda.\n\n\"It's not right what they are doing. I know for them they get something out of it, but it's also wrong to defraud parents and Ugandans of their children,\" he said.\n\nKabogoza's fear is that by leaving Uganda, many of these orphans will lose sight of their cultural identity.\n\nHe also believes that regardless of the circumstances, many of these children would be better off with their birth parents.\n\n\"That is the biggest thing that ever happens to a child. If the child remains with the family, they are able to grow up with them,\"said Kabogoza.\n\nHe added: \" know they feel what is done in America and what is proper in America is a better life. But you could provide that better life to the child here, within the family ...

The chip, from the edge of the area, sails harmlessly wide but Torres' movement is impressive.\n\n6th minute: The former Chelsea forward has put himself about in the early stages but, unfortunately for him, he has been just a little bit over-eager.

That' his first sight of goal - well, when he's been onside anyway...\n\nRamos (left) is fouled by Torres as both run and try to compete for the ball at the Vicente Calderon\n\n21st minute: The striker defends a Real corner well and blasts it clear.\n\n23rd minute:\u00a0As Antoine Griezmann advances with the ball, Torres makes a run in behind the Real defence but his French team-mate cannot find him. The Spaniard throws his arm down in frustration. He then runs deep into his own half, challenges well and advances into the Real half before being tackled by Marcelo. Torres is not happy about the challenge, but the referee waves away his protests.\n\nTorres waits for the ball to drop before attempting to control it during the Copa del Rey last-16 tie\n\n28th minute: Again Torres is caught offside. He is returning from an offside position but cannot get back onside before Raul Garcia's header reaches him.\n\n30th minute: Torres is still putting himself about and he jumps to compete for the ball with Sami Khedira. A flailing arm sees him catch the German midfielder and he gives a foul away. Khedira responds in kind by pushing his arm intro Torres' face when the Spaniard tries to get round him 30 seconds later and the Real midfielder is cautioned as a result.\n\nThe Spanish striker skips over a challenge from Ramos as he breaks clear of the Real defence\n\n41st minute: James Rodriguez sends in a corner for Real and Torres expertly heads clear to avert any danger.\n\n42nd minute: Marcelo wins the ball off Torres who gives the Brazilian a small touch in the back. He falls to the floor and Torres is penalised. It's soft but it probably is a foul. Torres himself is then fouled by Alvaro Arbeloa, with the Spaniard also going down very easily.\n\nTorres tires to take on Real defender Marcelo during Wednesday night's match at the Vicente Calderon\n\n50th minute: Torres backs into Ramos on the right wing and a free-kick is given in the Spaniard's favour as he is brought to the ground.\n\n51st minute: The striker leaps well in the middle of the pitch to get a little flick on to strike partner Griezmann, but the Frenchman's shot is high and wide.\n\nTorres looks round after being brought to ground by Real defender Raphael Varane on Wednesday night\n\n56th minute:\u00a0Great use of his body and brilliant strength from Torres sees Atletico break down the right and it eventually creates a chance for Griezmann.\n\n59th minute: Torres is clapped off the pitch and then given a congratulatory slap on the back by coach Diego Simeone as he is replaced by Koke. An industrious performance by Torres but he was caught offside far too regularly and was unable to muster a real chance of note all night. He will hope that a return to full fitness over the coming weeks will enable him to rediscover his best form. On the basis of this match though, that could be a long time coming...\n\nScarves with Torres' named and number 19 were on display at stalls around the ground before the game\n\nThe result saw Torres finish on the winning side against Real as an Atletico player for the first time.\n\nSpeaking after the game, he said: 'There was plenty to celebrate.

She is just as poorly. The difference is that her doctors have been able to diagnose and treat her quicker. She really hasn't been at all well, though.'\n\nThe Duchess was forced to cancel her first solo overseas visit \u2013 a trip to Malta \u2013 last month because of the severity of her condition. Last fortnight she also reluctantly cancelled a visit to a project by The Art Room in London and several other forthcoming engagements have now been scratched out of her diary.\n\nCaitlin Dean, of the charity Pregnancy Sickness Support, said: 'Hyperemesis gravidarum is not morning sickness. It is a chronic and debilitating condition that can cause sufferers to vomit up to 30 times a day.'\n\nHyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies.\n\nThe condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of \u2018pregnancy hormone\u2019 HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception.\n\nIt causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis.\n\nIt is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers.\n\nThe severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences.\n\nThey cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week.\n\nIt can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food.\n\nHyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat.\n\nHospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated.\n\nTreatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition.\n\nAn intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice.\n\nThe condition can also affect the baby\u2019s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 10, 15, 21, 23, 4, 5, 12, 14, 19], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Kanye West has proposed to Kim Kardashian.\nShe arranged for the words 'PLEEESE MARRY MEEE!!!' to flash up on The scoreboard.\nOn Tuesday morning, the delighted new mother posted a black and white picture of her new bling in front of the romantic scoreboard message.\nKanye was in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Film Awards earlier in the day.", "text": "Kanye West has proposed to girlfriend of 18 months Kim Kardashian days after telling the audience at his concert in Seattle on Saturday that he planned to marry her 'one day.'\n\nThe 36-year-old rapper popped the question to the reality star on her 33rd birthday on Monday with a 15 carat diamond ring at the AT&T Park baseball park in San Francisco, and later surprised her with family and friends pouring out of the dugouts, reports E!.\n\nWest had arranged for the words 'PLEEESE MARRY MEEE!!!' to flash up on the giant scoreboard.\n\nIn a snap posted on Instagram, Kim can be seen holding her ring finger towards the camera as she flashes her gigantic dazzling engagement band while smiling broadly alongside her man.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the delighted new mother posted a black and white picture of her new bling in front of the romantic scoreboard message, with the simple caption: 'Yes!!!'\n\nScroll down for video...\n\nSay cheese: While the Kardashian clan posted many photographs on social media, the couple are displeased about unauthorised video footage which Hurley took and shared of the moment of the proposal\n\n'YES!!!': Kim tweeted this picture on Tuesday morning after her exciting evening\n\nLavish proposal: Kanye presented his fiance\u00e9 with a 15 carat diamond ring by Lorraine Schwartz as 'PLEEEASE MARRY MEEEE!!!' flashed on the field's scoreboard screen\n\nKanye was in Los Angeles earlier in the day at the Hollywood Film Awards, and it was therefore unclear whether he planned to spend Kim's birthday with her.\n\nThe rapper flew in from San Francisco on Monday to present director Steve McQueen with a special honor award at the ceremony, and it appears he flew straight back to the Bay Area city straight afterwards to see the mother of his child.\n\nKim is said to have boarded a private jet that afternoon with her family in Los Angeles.\n\nThe happy couple: Kim and Kanye pose with a fellow guest as they celebrated with family and friends after the rapper popped the question\n\nGetting in on the act: Kim's half sister Kylie Jenner's boyfriend Jaden Smith is seen here, right, in another snap posted on Instagram and was among the family who came to the stadium\n\nJoyous news: Kim's sister Kourtney posted her own photograph from the stadium, with the accompanying caption: 'She said YES!'\n\nKanye's future mother-in-law: Kris Jenner tweeted a selfie and thanked Larry Baer, the chief executive officer of the San Francisco Giants, for his help in arranging the proposal\n\nRomantic\n setting: The AT&T baseball park in San Francisco was Kanye's venue \nof choice for his proposal to Kim Kardashian, it overlooks the San \nFrancisco Bay which must have been drenched in moonlight at night\n\nKris Jenner described the couple as: 'A match made in heaven!', adding: 'I am so happy for both of my kids, Kim and Kanye.'\n\nKanye,\n who is in the midst of a world tour, popped the question to the mother \nof his child after serenading her with a 50 piece orchestra.\n\nThe band struck up the romantic ballad Young And Beautiful from film The Great Gatsby by songstress Lana Del Rey, followed by his own hit with Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo, Knock You Down.\n\nThe proposal left Kim speechless, for once.\n\n'She was shocked and couldn't speak after,' a source a the scene told People magazine.

the same as a spec of dust - is enough to kill someone, due to its slowly-excreted alpha particles which affect the body's organs.\n\nAfter ingestion, Polonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract.\n\nSerious illness would not be expected for a month, due to the amount of time it takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures.\n\nAs the severity of the exposure develops in the body, victims usually lose hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed.\n\nThis later leads to severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, loss of fluids, and disturbance of electrolyte balance.\n\nThough it takes 5-6 weeks to seriously affect most, the symptoms of Polonium poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko (above), who fell ill the day after he was exposed.\n\nThe Russian died 23 days after being exposed, an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage.\n\nBochud said the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210.\n\n'But we have to do it quite fast because \npolonium is decaying, so if we wait too long, for sure, any possible \nproof will disappear,' he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIt emerged today that Palestinians are ready to accept a medical examination of Arafat's body if his family agrees, according to a Palestinian official.\n\nThe comments from Tawfiq Tirawi, who led a Palestinian probe into Arafat's death, came just hours after the Al-Jazeera investigation showed the Palestinian leader might have been poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium.\n\nThe official told AP: 'After the Al-Jazeera broadcast I met today with president (Mahmud) Abbas and recommended accepting an analysis of the body of the martyr president Arafat, and Abbas for his part agreed on the condition that the family... accepts.'\n\nPolonium was found to have caused the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, and he was assumed to have been deliberately poisoned.\n\nArafat's widow Suha said she would ask for Arafat's body - buried in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian self-rule authority - to be exhumed.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the documentary, aired on Al Jazeera's English and Arabic channels, she said: 'We have to go further and exhume Yasser Arafat's body to reveal the truth to all the Muslim and Arab world.'\n\nArafat led the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's fight against Israel from the 1960s but signed a peace agreement with the Jewish state in 1993 establishing Palestinian self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nHis mysterious death came four years into a Palestinian uprising, after years of talks with Israel failed to lead to a Palestinian state.\n\nFrench doctors who treated Arafat in his final days could not establish the cause of death.\n\nFrench officials refused to give details of his condition, citing privacy laws, fuelling a host of rumours and theories over the nature of his illness."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 12, 15, 4, 19, 23, 5, 10, 21, 14], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Bill Cosby co-starred in NBC's I Spy and won three Emmys.\nIn 1984, two decades later, Cosby made another pioneering TV achievement.\nHis first NBC series after The 1969 sitcom showcased him as a high-school coach.\nHis next series came in 1972: a weekly variety series called The New Bill Cosby Show.\nIt lasted two months.\nCBS's \"Kids Say the Darndest Things\" (1998-2000) is with Cosby interviewing children.", "text": "(CNN) -- In 1965 Bill Cosby made TV history and changed the face of television. He co-starred in NBC's \"I Spy,\" becoming the first African-American male to star in a prime-time network drama -- and won three Emmys doing it.\n\nIn 1984, two decades later, Cosby made another pioneering TV achievement, reviving the then-dormant sitcom form by starring as the patriarch of a loving family called the Huxtables. The Cosby Show soon was TV's No. 1 show, and helped make NBC television's No. 1 network -- all while blasting another programming myth: That white viewers wouldn't embrace an all-black TV show.\n\nNow, 30 years after doctor and dad Cliff Huxtable, and almost 50 years after tennis trainer and secret agent Alexander Scott, NBC is returning to the Bill Cosby well one more time -- and hoping his stardom, fan base and legacy can bring some much-needed magic to broadcast television in the 21st century.\n\nThe Deadline Hollywood website has reported that NBC and Cosby, partnered with producer Tom Werner (part owner of the company that produced \"The Cosby Show\"), have reached an agreement to produce a family sitcom starring Cosby.\n\nThe question is, can lightning strike thrice? Can Cosby make TV history yet again? And is it even fair to expect or ask him to?\n\nRemember, first of all, that not every Bill Cosby TV series has been a guaranteed hit. After \"I Spy,\" Cosby scored big in the children's television arena, with the animated \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" and his playful appearances on \"The Electric Company\" and \"Sesame Street.\" But his prime-time series didn't always score as successes.\n\nHis first NBC series after \"I Spy,\" the 1969 sitcom \"The Bill Cosby Show,\" showcased him as a high-school coach and phys ed teacher. It was a very smart series, and positioned Cosby's Chet Kincaid in a strong position of authority, but it didn't catch on.\n\nHis next series -- for CBS this time -- came in 1972: a weekly variety series called \"The New Bill Cosby Show.\" Its key ingredients, in addition to Cosby's weekly comic monologues, included dancer-actress Lola Falana, pretend drunk Foster Brooks, and bandleader Quincy Jones. But this show, in an era when variety shows were as ubiquitous as reality shows are today, was gone after one season.\n\n1976's \"Cos,\" for ABC, was a variety show aimed at youngsters. It lasted two months. Then came \"The Cosby Show,\" eight seasons of which singlehandedly moved TV from the topical and raw comedy of Norman Lear's sitcoms to an era in which television parents regained control, and family civility returned.\n\nAfter \"The Cosby Show\" were more Cosby series, ones that never captured the same zeitgeist: NBC's \"The Cosby Mysteries\" (1994-95), and CBS's \"Cosby\" sitcom (1996-2000, re-teaming him with \"Cosby Show\" TV spouse Phylicia Rashad), and an \"Art Linkletter's House Party\" sequel of sorts: CBS's \"Kids Say the Darndest Things\" (1998-2000), with Cosby interviewing children.\n\nIn other words, over his TV career, Bill Cosby has hit as many singles and doubles as home runs. At 76, does Cosby have another long-ball miracle in him?\n\nMy bet is that he can, indeed, do it again -- provided he swings for the fences, and that NBC does nothing to impede Cosby from following his instincts and doing precisely what he wants.\n\nThe major warning flag, on NBC right now, is \"The Michael J. Fox Show,\" which has returned another '80s NBC sitcom icon to television -- but not successfully, because the network seemed to think that merely signing Fox and bringing him back was enough. It isn't. You need the right role, the right writers and the right cast, and you have to put them all together at the right time.\n\nBut Cosby, like a comedy locust, seems amazingly designed to surface every two or three decades and capture the imagination. In the right vehicle, he can do it again.\n\nHis timing and his jokes were on full, hilarious display in last year's Comedy Central standup special, whose title may prove prophetic: \"Bill Cosby: Far from Finished.\" Can his humor still work today, when, as always, he avoids going \"blue\"? It certainly worked on Comedy Central. Blue, black -- Bill Cosby never has made color more of a priority than universality.\n\nIf I were given a vote in designing Cosby's 21st-century sitcom comeback vehicle, I'd craft it as a dual home life/workplace vehicle, like the classic \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\" At home, let Cosby be the family grandpa, holding court over a loving, lively, extended family.\n\nBut let him to go work beyond retirement age, too, as a tenured college professor or a veteran media pundit on a TV talk show. Either way, he'd get to vent about current events, forgotten history and anything else the real William H. Cosby Ph.D. would care to bring to the viewing public via prime-time TV.\n\nIncluding, of course, his observations on family and other parts of his still-funny monologues. More than 50 years after he released his first comedy album, Bill Cosby is a very funny fellow.

The job was described as a \"fastball\", which meant that an immediate response to the threat was required. The threat was also regarded as credible.\n\n'On that basis, requests for close protection officers to make themselves available for this job were put out on Facebook pages and groups which are strictly for approved and highly qualified security personnel. A number of close protection officers came forward and were briefed about the threat to Tony Hall.\n\n'The security operation took various forms, including personal security at home and following his car when he was driving.

For others it is the first step on a road that will lead to adoption and a new life.\n\nWhile traditional adoption hotspots are becoming less attractive -- Russia has banned Americans from adopting children, and it can take years to navigate China's adoption bureaucracy -- Uganda is seen as a quick and easy alternative for prospective parents.\n\nOpinion: Russia's adoption ban harms kids\n\nIn Uganda, the adoption process can take just a few months to complete. The country is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, a treaty which provides a blueprint for safe international adoptions.\n\nMany of the children adopted from Uganda are given a better shot at life overseas - certainly in material terms -- but the speed and ease of the process has many observers worried.\n\nFreda Luzinda worked at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, for two years processing adoption visas. She is now the Uganda national director of the A Child's Voice, an NGO promoting child rights and welfare.\n\nShe says that many birth parents in Uganda don't fully understand what adoption actually means and that there is no word for 'adoption' in the local Luganda language.\n\n\"I can say that about 60% of the birth parents that I spoke to didn't understand adoption,\" said Luzinda.\n\nMany birth parents do not understand that adoption is permanent. They believe they may get their children back later. These misconceptions are part of the problem, but not the only problem.\n\nThe rise in Ugandan adoptions over the past few years has created a growing number of orphanages and adoption agencies to meet the demand.\n\n\"When I first started processing visas at the embassy... there were probably between seven and 10 orphanages that were putting children up for adoption. And the numbers grew, and they grew, and they grew. By the time I finished, and this was two years later, we had a count, and we were dealing with about 100 orphanages.\" said Luzinda.\n\nThe explosive growth of the adoption industry in Uganda has fueled fears that children are being exploited for profit and that the best interests of the child is not paramount.\n\n\"Orphan creation does happen a lot in Uganda, and this is done by adoption facilitators who will go and scout the slums, find vulnerable families and talk them into giving up their children,\" said Luzinda.\n\nIn the 12 years from 1999-2010 there were just 311 adoptions from Uganda to the U.S. In 2011 alone -- the last year for which State Department numbers are available -- 207 children were adopted to the U.S. from Uganda.\n\nBrothers Zach, age about 4 and Philip, about a year older, have found a loving family in the U.S. but their early life was typical of Uganda's estimated 2.4 million orphans.\n\nBoth boys were found abandoned in different places in Kampala, both were left in conspicuous places and both were found by police officers.\n\nNow Zach and Philip have a new life in the U.S., both are in school and having loving new parents.\n\nIn 2008, they were adopted by Lisa and Tague Harding of Minnesota through the Amani Baby Cottage, one of the respected, religiously-affiliated orphanages.\n\n\"There is always a tragedy at the beginning of a story that makes adoption a necessary step,\" said Lisa.\n\nAs their children grew up and left home, the Hardings saw an opportunity to provide a stable home for children who would otherwise grow up in poverty.\n\nInternet reveals secrets of 'closed' adoptions, report says\n\nThe Hardings became interested in international adoption after traveling to Uganda with a church group.\n\n\"I love that in our faith, adoption is part of the story -- that Baby Moses was adopted and there was Samuel in the Bible that was adopted and baby Jesus. Joseph was not his birth father.\" said Lisa.\n\nDanyne Randolph Bharj, director of the Amani Baby Cottage, understands the fears concerning the exploitation of children, but says that given the options for Ugandan children, in many cases adoption is the best solution.\n\n\"I don't think it's right to say the West is the way to save Uganda at all. I don't think that's the answer. But I think if there's people in the West that can give these children a family when no one else can, I do think it's more important,\" said Bharj.\n\nBut James Kabogoza, assistant commissioner of Children's Affairs for the Ugandan Government, feels that Ugandan children should stay in Uganda.\n\n\"It's not right what they are doing. I know for them they get something out of it, but it's also wrong to defraud parents and Ugandans of their children,\" he said.\n\nKabogoza's fear is that by leaving Uganda, many of these orphans will lose sight of their cultural identity.\n\nHe also believes that regardless of the circumstances, many of these children would be better off with their birth parents.\n\n\"That is the biggest thing that ever happens to a child. If the child remains with the family, they are able to grow up with them,\"said Kabogoza.\n\nHe added: \" know they feel what is done in America and what is proper in America is a better life. But you could provide that better life to the child here, within the family ... You can change the life of that child within the family here, if you support them.\"\n\nZach and Philip' adopted father, Tague Harding, understands that his sons will lose some of their cultural heritage by growing up in the United States, but he also sees the advantages.\n\n\"It's better that Ugandan orphans stay in Uganda as much as possible but perhaps by us bringing two boys home or other people bringing Ugandan children back internationally, we can raise awareness to say, there is a need.\"\n\nLisa Desai, Sarah Gross, Yasmeen Qureshi of Three Strands Media produced \"Adopting Africa\" for CNN.

He finished his second term as governor in January 2011, after being censured and fined tens of thousands of dollars for ethics violations, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity.\n\nBut he came back, beating out 15 other candidates earlier this year to win the Republican nomination in the race for the vacant House seat. From the start, Sanford was very open about the affair on the campaign trail and made it the subject of his first TV ad.\n\nAnd even with all his political baggage, he was considered the favorite in the race until last month, when court documents revealed his ex-wife had filed complaints against Sanford for trespassing on her property.\n\nSanford told CNN that he didn't want to leave his sons home alone while their mother was away. He's scheduled for a court appearance two days after the election.\n\nNot long after the trespassing story broke, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced it was pulling out of the race and national Democratic groups announced they were throwing more money into the contest.\n\nAnd National Democratic groups jumped in. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and independent pro-Democrat House Majority PAC combined dished out nearly $1 million to defeat Sanford.\n\nThe two groups, as well as Colbert Busch, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch brought up Sanford's 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress.\n\n\"When we talk about fiscal spending and we talk about protecting the taxpayers, it doesn't mean you take that money we saved and leave the country for a personal purpose,\" she said sternly, looking directly at her opponent on stage.\n\nIn South Carolina politics, two very different campaign styles\n\nAnd her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for using \"tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character.\"\n\nThe DCCC and House Majority PAC have also spotlighted the affair in their final ads.\n\n\"I used to be for Mark Sanford, but not any more. He skipped town to be with his mistress on Father's Day. Sanford even asked his wife for permission to have the affair,\" said Mt. Pleasant Republican voter Jennifer Stark in the House Majority PAC commercial.\n\nBut over the past month, another woman also entered the campaign spotlight: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nSanford and his campaign repeatedly tried to tie Colbert Busch to Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections.\n\nOpinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace\n\n\"I've fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country. Maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest is bigger than them or me, it's about two different visions of how we restore America and reign in Washington spending,\" Sanford said, looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide last week.\n\nTwo weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate.\n\nSanford also repeatedly brought up the money that national Democratic groups have poured into the South Carolina race.\n\n\"What it says is, whose voice do you carry when you go to Washington D.C.?\" he said in the debate with Colbert Busch, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that national Democratic groups have spent on the race.\n\nColbert Busch, responding to the Sanford criticism, sought to distance herself from Washington and from national Democrats.\n\n\"No one tells me what to do except the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. So a victory for Elizabeth Colbert Busch is a victory for the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District,\" she told CNN Monday, adding that two-thirds of her contributions have come from within the Palmetto State.\n\nWhile Sanford touted his fiscal conservative record, Colbert Bush campaigned as an independent centrist who would buck President Barack Obama. In her CNN interview, she highlighted where she doesn't see eye to eye with the president.\n\n\"I respectfully disagree with his budget,\" she said, adding that \"we need to vote to repair\" the president's health care law.\n\nEven though they didn't support Sanford, the NRCC congratulated him Tuesday night, and said the results could prove troublesome for House Democrats in 2014.\n\n\"Democrats spent more than $1 million trying to elect a candidate who was backed by the Democrat machine, but at the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch,\" Rep. Greg Walden, NRCC chairman, said in a statement.\n\nBut national Democrats see a silver lining in Colbert Busch's defeat.\n\n\"House Republicans' outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face. Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until Election Day,\" Rep. Steve Israel, DCCC chairman, said in a statement. \"In this deep red Republican district that Mitt Romney won by 18 points, the fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates.\"\n\nSanford has a woman problem\n\nThe congressional seat became vacant when Rep. Tim Scott, who won re-election by 27 percentage points last November, was picked by GOP Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat of Sen. Jim DeMint, who stepped down late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nNo Democrat has held the seat in more than 30 years, and that streak still stands."}, {"annotators_ids": [12, 6, 14, 5, 10, 15, 19, 21, 4, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Women who took iron supplements were 10 % more likely to die during the 22 - year study.\nFolic acid, vitamin B6, magnesium, zinc, copper, and multivitamins were also associated with an increased risk of earlier death.\nCalcium was the only supplement associated with a lower risk of death during the study.\nAbout half of all adults reported taking supplements in 2000.\nJust over 40 % of the women had died by the time the study ended in 2008.\nThe use of dietary supplements has exploded in the United States in recent decades, according to a new study.", "text": "(Health.com) -- Older women have a slightly increased risk of dying at an earlier age if they take multivitamins or certain other dietary supplements, according to a new study published today in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nOf the 15 supplements included in the study, iron was most strongly linked to an increased risk of earlier death. Women who took iron supplements were 10% more likely to die during the 22-year study than women who did not take them, even after the researchers controlled for several other health and demographic factors.\n\nFolic acid, vitamin B6, magnesium, zinc, copper, and multivitamins were also associated with an increased risk of earlier death. Calcium was the only supplement associated with a lower risk of death during the study.\n\n\"I don't think we really know enough to be prescribing supplements,\" says David Jacobs Jr., Ph.D., the senior author of the study and a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis.\n\nJacobs stresses, however, that people who have been prescribed dietary supplements for a specific vitamin or nutrient deficiency should not stop taking them without consulting their doctor.\n\nHealth.com: Which vitamins do you need?\n\nThe study -- which shows only an association, not cause and effect -- has some key shortcomings. The researchers measured supplement intake using questionnaires that relied on the memory of the participants, for instance.\n\nIn addition, the researchers don't know whether the women were taking supplements for a health problem. The increases in death risk might therefore be due to underlying health conditions rather than the supplements themselves, says Susan Fisher, Ph.D., a professor of community and preventive medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in Rochester, N.Y.\n\n\"People [often] go to the vitamin store because they feel something isn't right -- their memory is slipping, they don't have as much energy,\" says Fisher, who was not involved in the new study. \"These could be subconscious symptoms of a disease that is eventually going to take their life.\"\n\nHealth.com: Heart trouble? 30 herbal remedies to avoid\n\nThe use of dietary supplements has exploded in the United States in recent decades. According to the study, roughly half of all adults reported taking supplements in 2000.\n\nThe rates were even higher among the 38,772 women in Iowa who participated in the study. Sixty-three percent were taking at least one supplement when the study began, in 1986, but by 2004 that number had jumped to 85%. And more than one-quarter of those women reported taking four or more supplements on a regular basis.\n\nThe women were 62 years old at the beginning of the study, on average, and none had chronic health conditions (with the exception of diabetes and high blood pressure). Just over 40% of the women had died by the time the study ended in 2008.\n\nWomen who took calcium -- which is known to reduce the risk of bone fractures associated with aging -- were 9% less likely to die during the study than women who did not take it, but most of the other supplements were associated with an increased risk of death. Some supplements, including beta-carotene, vitamins A and C, and selenium, didn't appear to affect death risk either way.\n\nHealth.com: 11 foods for healthy bones\n\nHowever, the increases in death risk (or decrease, in the case of calcium) were extremely small and may not be clinically meaningful, says Mary L. Chavez, a professor of pharmacy practice at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Kingsville.\n\nSeveral factors besides supplement use may have shaped the results. Fisher points out, for instance, that the use of hormone therapy to treat the symptoms of menopause was nearly twice as common among supplement users as among nonusers. Some forms of hormone therapy have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and breast cancer.\n\nThe researchers did take hormone therapy into account in their analysis, along with several other potentially mitigating factors (including age, educational attainment, body mass index, diet, and physical activity). But the wide disparity in hormone use between supplement users and nonusers may indicate that the two groups of women were different in subtle yet important ways, Fisher says.\n\nHealth.com: Can supplements ease menopause symptoms?\n\n\"People choosing to take [hormone] replacement therapy often have underlying different characteristics and lifestyle behaviors, which you can't necessarily balance out with a mathematical model,\" she says.\n\nIt's not clear that the study results apply to the population of older women as a whole. The study participants were white and tended to live in rural areas, so the findings can't necessarily be generalized to other races and geographic areas.\n\nStill, the study is a reminder that supplements may not be as harmless as they seem, Fisher says. \"Taking more of what we think is a good thing may not be so good,\" she says. \"High levels of nutrient supplements may be harmful, or at least not helpful.\"\n\nCopyright Health Magazine 2011"}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 12, 23, 4, 5, 14, 19, 21, 10, 15], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], "summary": "China exported $112.11 billion worth of goods and services in the month of March.\nCombining the first three months, China still recorded a trade surplus of $14.49 billion in the first quarter.", "text": "(CNN) -- China recorded a $7.24 billion trade deficit in March, the General Administration of Customs announced Saturday, according to state media Xinhua News Agency.\n\nIt was the country's first monthly trade deficit since April 2004, Xinhua reported.\n\nChina exported $112.11 billion worth of goods and services in the month of March -- an increase of 24.3 percent year on year, and imports rose 66 percent year on year to $119.35 billion, Xinhua reported.\n\nIn March, imports and exports increased by 42.8 percent year on year to $231.46 billion, according to the customs statistics.\n\nCombining the first three months, China still recorded a trade surplus of $14.49 billion in the first quarter, a fall of 76.7 percent from the same period of last year, Xinhua reported.\n\nIn the first quarter, China's imports and exports totaled $617.85 billion -- a rise of 44.1 percent year on year, Xinhua reported."}, {"annotators_ids": [19, 6, 10, 14, 15, 5, 12, 21, 4, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Former defence secretary may return to quash any dissent.\nTory whips believe they have uncovered two more plots against David Cameron.\nOne plot involves a former Army officer who has attempted to recruit supporters from among MPs who used to serve in the Armed Forces for what the leadership has branded a ' military coup '\nTreasury minister Greg Clark today dismissed rumours of an imminent leadership challenge as ' a load of rubbish '\nChief Whip Sir George Young called in Adam Afriyie for a dressing down last Thursday after he was named as the central figure in a plot to oust Mr Cameron as the Tory leader.", "text": "Liam Fox: The loyal supporter of David Cameron may return to quash any dissent as tensions in the party bubble over\n\nLiam Fox is being lined up for a Cabinet return to help crush three fledgling plots against David Cameron\u2019s leadership.\n\nSenior allies of the Prime Minister say he is considering making the former defence secretary chief whip to get a grip on his backbenchers as rebellion spreads even further than first thought.\n\nThe Mail can reveal that Tory whips believe they have uncovered two more plots against Mr Cameron after allies of backbencher Adam Afriyie were exposed last week for promoting him as the next Tory leader.\n\nThe second plot involves a former Army officer who has attempted to recruit supporters from among MPs who used to serve in the Armed Forces for what the leadership has branded a \u2018military coup\u2019 against the Prime Minister.\n\nAt least one minister and several Parliamentary Private Secretaries have been approached with a view to joining the conspiracy - though party managers believe most have said no.\n\nSeparately ministers ousted in Mr Cameron\u2019s last reshuffle and those who have never been given a job have also privately discussed whether to act against him.\n\nThis third \u2018plot\u2019 has not yet reached \u2018lift-off\u2019 according to MPs in the know.

It was sunny but cool, she remembers.\n\nLaura Geraghty was shocked 21 times before she came back from cardiac arrest with tales of the afterlife.\n\nThe mother of two, also a grandmother, was at her job, driving a school bus for the Newton Public School District in suburban Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nHer passengers, special-needs children, were wheelchair-bound.\n\nSeemingly in good health and in good spirits, Geraghty was finishing up her late-morning run, transporting a student and teacher back to Newton South High School, when she realized she was in trouble.\n\nAs she was pulling into the school parking lot, she began having sharp stomach pains. She was able to park her bus, but she kept feeling worse.\n\nThe pain \"went right up my arm and into my chest, and I said, 'Uh-oh, I'm having a heart attack,' \" she said.\n\nThe teacher ran from the bus to get help. Newton South's nurse, Gail Kramer, and CPR instructor Michelle Coppola arrived moments later with the school's new automated external defibrillator.\n\nGeraghty, barely conscious, was fading fast. She was weak and having trouble breathing. And then she went into full cardiac arrest.\n\n\"Her eyes were wide, and all of a sudden she stopped talking to us,\" Coppola said. \"I grabbed the two pads, stuck them on her, started it up, and I'd say within 20 seconds, she had her first shock.\"\n\nCoppola and Kramer performed CPR while they waited for paramedics.  See an expert give a quick lesson in CPR \u00bb\n\nAt that point, Geraghty says, her body died. She remembers watching the scene unfold -- as if from above.\n\n\"I floated right out of my body. My body was here, and I just floated away. I looked back at it once, and it was there.\"\n\nGeraghty says she saw deceased loved ones, her mother and her ex-husband.\n\n\"It was very peaceful and light and beautiful. And I remember like, when you see someone you haven't seen in a while, you want to hug them, and I remember trying to reach out to my ex-husband, and he would not take my hand. And then they floated away.\"\n\nNext, she says, she was overwhelmed by \"massive energy, powerful, very powerful energy.\"\n\n\"When that was happening, there were pictures of my son and my daughter and my granddaughter, and every second, their pictures flashed in my mind, and then I came back.\"\n\nWhat Geraghty had was a near-death experience, fairly common in people who go into sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nGeraghty was down for 57 minutes. No blood pressure, no pulse, no oxygen, no blood flow. She was shocked 21 times before she finally came back with tales of the afterlife.\n\nAccording to the Near Death Experience Research Foundation, nearly 800 near-death experiences happen every day in the United States.\n\nDr. Kevin Nelson, a neurologist in Lexington, Kentucky, studies near-death experiences and says they're not imagined. The explanation, he says, lies in the brain itself.\n\n\"These are real experiences. And they're experiences that happen at a time of medical crisis and danger,\" Nelson said.\n\nHumans have a lot of reflexes that help keep us alive, part of the \"fight or flight\" response that arises when we're confronted with danger.\n\nNelson thinks that near-death experiences are part of the dream mechanism and that the person having the experience is in a REM, or \"rapid eye movement,\" state.\n\n\"Part of our 'fight or flight' reflexes to keep us alive includes the switch into the REM state of consciousness,\" he said.\n\nDuring REM sleep, there is increased brain activity and visual stimulation. Intense dreaming occurs as a result.\n\nAnd the bright light so many people claim to see?\n\n\"The activation of the visual system caused by REM is causing the bright lights,\" Nelson said.\n\nAnd the tunnel people speak of, he says, is lack of blood flow to the eye. \"The eye, the retina of the eye, is one of the most exquisitely sensitive tissues to a loss of blood flow. So when blood flow does not reach the eye, vision fails, and darkness ensues from the periphery to the center. And that is very likely causing the tunnel effect.\"\n\nNelson is doing studies now to prove that the same effect results from fainting.\n\n\"The most common cause of near-death experience in my research group is fainting. Upwards of 100 million Americans have fainted. That means probably tens of millions of Americans have had these unusual experiences.\"\n\nBut Geraghty says this was no dream. \"I know I went someplace else. I know I went someplace else other than here.\"\n\nDr. Bill O'Callahan, the emergency room doctor who shocked her back to life, agrees. \"Cynics out there would say and agnostics would say that's phenomenon that comes from a dying brain. I think that's hogwash. I firmly believe that people experience these events.\" Cheating Death: Back from the dead\n\nBob Schriever, co-founder of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association, was refereeing a high school football game seven years ago when he went into cardiac arrest, died and was revived.\n\nHe, too, questions the dream explanation. \"Why are so many people dreaming the same thing? How can so many people, and there's hundreds of thousands of people who have experienced this, how can we all be dreaming the same thing and describe the exact same thing?\"\n\nSchriever says these experiences are so profound that only someone who has gone through them can truly understand.\n\nSeven years later, he is still consumed with his own near-death experience.\n\n\"I think about that every morning when I wake up, first thing, during the day, I don't know how many times and every night before I fall asleep. I think about that. People do not understand or appreciate what we go through.\" Scientist uses poison gas to suspend life\n\nFor Geraghty, it's a daily struggle to put the pieces back together again.\n\n\"I've been someplace that not everybody can go, and there's not a lot of people you can sit down and have that conversation with,\" Geraghty said. \"My own daughter tells me, 'It's freaky, Mom.' I've literally lost friends over this the minute they hear it.\" Tweet your own experience and you could win a copy of \"Cheating Death\"\n\nGeraghty says she became depressed once she left the hospital because her perspective on her entire life changed. She still gets depressed, she says, and is on medication.\n\n\"I actually went to my doctor and said to her, 'I think I'm losing my mind. This can't be really happening,' you know, and she said it's OK, it's very hard to understand when you've been through an experience like that.\"\n\nGeraghty has joined the cardiac arrest group, hoping that connecting with others who understand what she's been through will allow her to come to terms with what happened to her that cool spring day six months ago. And allow her to heal and move on."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 19, 21, 4, 5, 10, 12, 14, 15, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Drug smugglers are throwing everything they ' ve got at getting drugs into the U.

The most sophisticated tunnels have lights, air systems and hydraulics. While drugs flow north into the United States, weapons and cash flow south into Mexico.\n\nThe smuggling organizations are well-established and sophisticated. They have a recognized hierarchy and employ the latest technology, said Rafael Reyes, chief of global enforcement operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  Watch the creative techniques drug smugglers are using \u00bb\n\nBorder agents have found radios, cells phones and global positioning system tracking devices, leading officials to believe drug cartels positioned on or close to the border are in constant contact with drug runners.\n\n\"These guys are very ingenious,\" Reyes said. \"They will exploit any vulnerability that they can.\"\n\nReyes said that means factoring in the possibility a certain percentage of drugs will be seized by federal agents: \"They'll line up 10 loads, and if you pick off two or three, well, that's the cost of doing business, 'I got seven across.' So it's that shotgun mentality.\"\n\nThe same thinking applies to drugs smuggled in the waters of the eastern Pacific off the coasts of Central and South America.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Capt. Vincent DeLaurentis and his crew on the cutter Hamilton came back from three months of searching for drugs inbound to Mexico. They covered an area of ocean about the size of the Southeastern United States. They captured six hard-to-detect boats that travel at night and seized 30,000 pounds of pure cocaine.\n\nDeLaurentis said drug traffickers have become much more aggressive in their smuggling tactics. Among the new trends, he said, \"They're using vessels that are less and less detectable, whether it's these go-fast boats that travel at night or the new self-propelled semi-submersible vessels.\"    Click here for photos of the ways in which drugs are moved into the U.S. \u00bb\n\nKnown as SPSS, self-propelled semi-submersibles are something like submarines, but they cannot fully submerge. Anywhere from several inches to a couple of feet remain above the water line; they are painted a blue or gray for camouflage, and they are flat on top with valves and air holes.\n\nThey are difficult to detect and have become increasingly sophisticated. Some can travel up to 5,000 miles and use fuel tanks for ballast. They can carry some seven to 10 tons of drugs, and because of their low profiles and low radar signatures, the vessels are popular, DeLaurentis said.\n\nThe submersibles are built in the rebel-controlled jungles of Colombia, and the U.S. Coast Guard said cartels pay for construction. The craft rendezvous with fishing vessels or \"go-fasts\" -- boats that are typically 40 feet long, go 40 knots and can carry several tons of heroin or cocaine. The drugs then go to Mexico, where the cargo is offloaded and transported across the border into the U.S.\n\n\"The fact they're developing semi-subs that can carry huge amounts of drugs and running those vessels for thousands of miles tells me that it's a very sophisticated operation,\" said Capt. Tom Farris, commander of Coast Guard Sector San Diego.\n\nThe Coast Guard tries to engage and board these vessels before they get to Mexico. But evidence of drug smuggling needed for prosecution is hard to come by --- because traffickers on these crafts easily can escape by opening a hatch, tossing out a life raft and then scuttling the vessel to the bottom of the ocean along with its cargo.\n\nA U.S. law signed in January makes it illegal to operate a stateless SPSS and will allow the Coast Guard to arrest people it used to have to release because drug evidence was on the bottom of the ocean.\n\nMexico produces three out of the four major abused drugs in the United States -- marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines, according to the DEA. Cocaine, however, comes from South America, but it and the other three drugs are all shipped through Mexico into the United States.\n\n\"Mexico has become a vital hub,\" Reyes said.\n\nAccording to the DEA, 90 percent of all cocaine destined for the U.S. comes through the Mexican-Central American corridor, with 47 percent not stopping in Central America but going to Mexico.\n\nThe primary transit routes from Mexico into the U.S. are: Tijuana to San Diego, Sonora to Phoenix, Arizona; Chihuahua to El Paso, Texas; and the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which will cover the remaining south of the border, to the Texas cities of Laredo and Brownsville.\n\n\"Those are the principal lucrative corridors,\" Reyes said. They are \"controlled by separate organizations because of the market they have in the United States, and it is a profit-minded approach they take in securing these corridors for themselves.\"\n\nThe San Ysidro port of entry is the busiest border crossing with Mexico and the United States. More than 110,000 people pass through every day, making it fertile ground for drug cartels looking for new ways to ship drugs.\n\nPort Director Oscar Preciado oversees the San Ysidro crossing. On any given day, he said agents seize five to 10 loads -- about 50 to 500 pounds of marijuana, cocaine, heroin or methamphetamines. Recent seizures include marijuana in tires and heroin in phony  fuel tanks, some with secret levers.\n\n\"They'll put it anywhere they can, and they're very creative in creating their own compartments and concealing them,\" Preciado said.\n\nWith border security tighter than ever, Preciado said drug traffickers are paying kids as young as 14 to smuggle dope -- mostly marijuana.\n\nDrug traffickers who frequently bribe Mexican police are now trying to bribe U.S. agents. While rare, officials said, it is serious. \"Corruption is one of our major concerns. We do everything we can to stop corruption,\" Preciado said.\n\nWith billions of dollars at stake, cartels will try anything, officials said. \"If we can't catch the drugs, what we want to do is make them spend more resources in order to get the drugs across the border,\" said the Coast Guard's Farris."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 10, 23, 4, 5, 15, 19, 12, 14, 21], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Reese Witherspoon was arrested on April 19 after disobeying an officer's order to stay in the car.\nShe was enraged at her arrest and accused the officer of harassment.\nReese: ' I'm pregnant and I need to use the restroom '.\nShe asks.", "text": "Video footage has emerged of the moment Reese Witherspoon got into a drunken confrontation with a police office which resulted in her arrest for disorderly conduct.\n\nThe one and a half minute film, taken from the patrol car's dash camera and posted on TMZ, shows Reese slurring and screaming at a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia following her husband Jim Toth's arrest for DUI.\n\nReese was arrested for on April 19 after disobeying an officer's order to stay in the car.\n\nAfter repeated requests from the police officer and her husband to stay quiet, her antagonistic exchange with the police officer ended in her being handcuffed and charged.\n\nFurious: The moment captured on the police car's dash camera which shows Reese Witherspoon (bottom right) arrested for disorderly conduct\n\nIn the video, an agitated Reese attempts to protest after husband Jim was handcuffed after failing a field sobriety test.\n\nThe officer told the actress several times to sit down and stay in the car, much to her chagrin.\n\n'I'm pregnant and I need to use the restroom,' she calls to the officer\n - something she told GMA on Thursday morning was untrue.\n\nSeemingly unable to listen, Reese gets out of the car and begins arguing with the officer who promptly arrests her.\n\nHands behind your back: Reese was enraged at her arrest and accused the officer of harassment\n\nDo you know my name?

Now people can see it for themselves.'\n\nBut the money now earmarked by GAVI will help to bridge the gap and is expected to be enough to procure up to 12 million courses of a vaccine.\n\nWHO vaccine expert Marie-Paule Kieny, said the commitment is 'fantastic'.\n\nIn addition to helping tackle the current epidemic, the money could also be used to create stockpiles of Ebola vaccines, similar to those that exist for yellow fever, meningitis and cholera.\n\nA further $90 million will be made available from GAVI's funds to help those affected in the hardest hit nations, and introduce the vaccines while helping to rebuild their broken health systems.\n\nGAVI, which was set up in 2000 with private and government donor backing, has a track record of bulk-buying vaccine supplies from

decided to prepare for procuring Ebola vaccines while still awaiting a green light for the first product, 'in light of the seriousness of the situation and the risks associated with delays in making a vaccine available'.\n\nTwo vaccines, one from NewLink and Merck and a rival shot from GlaxoSmithKline, are already undergoing human trials and third one, made by Johnson & Johnson, is about to enter clinical testing.\n\n'We've had individual discussions with all of the manufacturers and continue to work closely with them,' GAVI's chief executive, Seth Berkley, said.\n\nGAVI said it would meet the

Appeals court challengers said in a court filing.\n\n'Major economic decisions like these - indeed, any decisions granting tax credits - must be made unambiguously by Congress itself.'\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety.\n\n'It is pretty obvious what the congressional intent was here,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, which was for every qualified American to receive a subsidy 'regardless of whether it was state officials or federal officials running the marketplace.'\n\nPierce said the D.C. ruling is 'at odds with the goal of the law.'\n\n'We believe that this decision is incorrect, inconsistent with \nCongressional intent,' the Justice Department official said.\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers to the law are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety\n\nAn appeals court filing by congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act, similarly argues that 'Congress did not provide that the tax credits would only be available to citizens whose states set up their own exchanges.'\n\nCongressional lawmakers and state legislators who are against the law hope that by limiting the subsidies to state exchanges, they can destabilize important aspects of the law, such as the individual mandate requiring most people to buy insurance.\n\nAndre \nDavis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge serving on the Richmond court, explained the court's decision this way:\n\n'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would\n be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham \nand pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from \nDomino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a \nliteral construction of my lunch order.'\n\nDavis and his colleagues voted to uphold what the Obama administration says was the 'intent' of law - subsidies for all qualified Americans, regardless of whether they signed up for coverage through the state or federal exchanges.\n\n'Today\u2019s ruling highlights the ramifications of hastily passing legislation before fully knowing and understanding what it entails and how it will affect people,' House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers said in a statement after the D.C. decision was handed down.\n\n'For months, people all across this country have seen firsthand the flawed and ineffective implementation of Obamacare \u2013 in their skyrocketing premiums, lost coverage, limited access, and regulatory inefficiencies.\n\n'And today\u2019s decision is only further evidence of the legislation\u2019s failure,' the GOP leader said.' It\u2019s time to listen to the American people, enact real health care reforms, and start over. This law does not work.'\n\nAndre \nDavis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge who wrote a concurring opinion on the Richmond court's decision, said he was not going to allow anti-Obamacare advocates to use the court to deny 'millions of Americans desperately-needed health insurance.'\n\nDavis admitted that the federal law was 'tortured' and it's construction was 'nonsensical' but it's 'manifest purpose, as revealed by the wholeness and coherence of its text and structure, could not be more clear.'\n\nIn an attempt to explain the law in lay terms, Davis offered up an equally tortured pizza-based analogy.\n\n'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would\n be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham \nand pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from \nDomino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a \nliteral construction of my lunch order,' he said.\n\nJudges on the D.C. case were Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush; A. Raymond Randolph, an appointee of Bush's father; and Harry Edwards, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, who dissented.\n\nA lower court had ruled that the law's text, structure, purpose, and legislative history make 'clear that Congress intended to make premium tax credits available on both state-run and federally-facilitated Exchanges.'\n\nBut the appeals court concluded the opposite - that the letter of the law 'unambiguously restricts' the law's subsidies to policies sold through exchanges established by the state.\n\n'An Exchange established by the federal government cannot possibly be \"an Exchange established by the State,\" ' Randolph wrote in a concurring opinion. 'To hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation.\n\n'Only further legislation could accomplish the expansion the government seeks.'\n\nIn a statement celebrating the D.C. court's decision, Sam Kazman, general counsel for the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, one of the organization's responsible for \nfunding the lawsuit said, 'The court\u2019s decision puts an end to the power grab that the IRS rule represented.\n\n'And more importantly it reaffirms the fact that we are a nation of laws enacted by Congress rather than rules issued by agenda-driven agencies,' Kazman added.\n\n'Despite all the political calls for the country to 'get with the program and support Obamacare,\" it\u2019s the Framers of the Constitution who have the last word.'"}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 14, 19, 5, 10, 12, 15, 21, 23, 4], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Mikhail Kravchenko, 46, was found dead in a pool of blood outside Moscow.\nHe had been pictured holding hands with the princess, 67, during a holiday in Venice.\nThe furniture tycoon was said to have been hauled from his car and shot up to ten times.\nPolice believe his murder could be connected to an attempt to seize his furniture business.\nPrincess Michael has always denied having an affair with Mr Kravachenko, 21 years her junior.\nThe pair met at an interior design exhibition the previous year.\nThe princess, nicknamed ' Princess Pushy ' because of her manner.", "text": "Princess Michael was said to be \u2018very distressed\u2019 last night after a Russian tycoon romantically linked to her was shot dead in a contract murder.\n\nMikhail Kravchenko, 46 \u2013 who had been pictured holding hands with the princess, 67, during a holiday in Venice \u2013 was found dead in an upmarket neighbourhood outside Moscow yesterday morning.\n\nThe bullet-riddled body of the millionaire, who had remained friendly with the princess, was discovered in a pool of blood beside his Mercedes in the\u00a0 suburb of Peredelkino.\n\nUneasy: Prince Michael looks on as Kravchenko casts an admiring glance at the princess at the Moscow conference in 2005\n\nThe furniture tycoon was said to have been hauled from his car and shot up to ten times.\n\nPolice confirmed it was carried out by two \u2018professional\u2019 gunmen who knew his whereabouts.\n\nThere was also a suggestion that there had been a mystery passenger with Mr Kravchenko in his car who later vanished.\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr Kravchenko may have fallen out with government figures before his death.\n\nPolice believe his murder could be connected to an attempt to seize his \u00a3130million-a-year furniture business, or to debts he ran up during the recession.\n\nAn unnamed source also claimed that before his death Mr Kravchenko had \u2018branched out into Russia\u2019s real estate and construction markets\u2019, both of which are \u2018notoriously corrupt\u2019, as the furniture market slowed down.\n\nThe source said: \u2018We cannot rule out the common scenario for such shootings \u2013 a debt he couldn\u2019t repay or a dispute over ownership of a company or property.\n\nHand-in-hand: Princess Michael of Kent with Russian millionaire Mikhail Kravchenko in Venice, where they spent four days together.

But I can\u2019t do that, he is part of our family.\u2019\n\nThe couple have another dog, a nine-year-old Corgi and Pomeranian cross called Babe.\n\n\u2018I want to take Scooby out for a walk with Babe, but he obviously cannot come,' said Mrs Richardson.\n\n'He is depressed, being unable to go on long walks is clearly getting him down. He loved chasing balls and loved going out for walks - it is so sad seeing him like this.\n\n\u2018We are all absolutely devastated, my son broke down when we told him we may have to give Scooby up. This is affecting us every day.'\n\n'Facing a huge bill': Mrs Richardson (pictured with Scooby) says she and other neighbours had been asking the council to cut the long grass outside their homes in Brighton, East Sussex, for a month before the incident\n\nShe added: 'He could be paralysed, he needs surgery as soon as possible - but we just do not have the money.\n\n\u2018Being in our situation, it is difficult - we are on benefits. I want to sue the council but we do not have any money to sue them, but it is unfair because the council are definitely liable for what happened.\n\n\u2018They should pay for the surgery, it is their fault and I am pointing the finger at the council.\u2019\n\nAndy Silvester, from the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018This is a perfect storm of council neglect and compensation culture gone mad.\n\n\u2018The council has got to do a better job of looking after the local area, but it\u2019s ridiculous that taxpayers will be left with a potentially huge bill.\u2019\n\nA spokesman for Brighton and Hove City Council said it will investigate any complaint Mrs Richardson makes."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 14, 15, 19, 21, 4, 5, 10, 12, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Only 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are held by black and ethnic minority ( BME ) coaches, a new report has revealed.\nOnly 3. 4 per cent of the coaches employed come from BME backgrounds despite making up 25 % of professional players.\nEnglish football often operates ' insider ' networks to recruit coaches based on personal connections rather than qualifications.", "text": "Former Reading striker Jason Roberts believes promising coaches and managers are being lost to the game simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nOnly 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are held by black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches, a new report has revealed.\n\nThe figures show that only 3.4 per cent of the coaches employed come from BME backgrounds despite making up 25 per cent of professional players.\n\nJason Roberts arrives for a meeting to discuss racism in football at 10 Downing Street in February 2012\n\nThe report was carried out by the Sports Person's Think Tank, which has called for English football to set an overall target of at least 20 per cent of coaches to be from BME backgrounds by 2020.\n\nRoberts, who is one of the founding members of the think tank, says in the report: 'It appears that football has lost successive generations of potential coaches and managers simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\n'The numbers do not add up, so many players from our communities who have achieved so much on the field of play - distinguished careers as senior players in some of the biggest clubs in this country, many with international caps, some who played at major tournaments - yet so few that have been given opportunities to achieve as coaches.\n\nRoberts scores for Reading against Southampton during his side's  npower Championship match in April 2012\n\n'Talk to these individuals about the realities they faced, the number of jobs they applied for, the number of interviews they had, and the feeling emerges that they have been the victims of a systematic denial of talent and ambition.\"\n\nThe report highlights that low numbers of coaches from BME backgrounds complete UEFA coaching qualifications, with potential coaches deterred from going into management due to the perceived lack of opportunity.\n\nThe report, funded by the European anti-discrimination body FARE, also states English football often operates 'insider' networks to recruit coaches based on personal connections rather than qualifications."}, {"annotators_ids": [4, 6, 10, 14, 19, 5, 12, 15, 21, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Atletico Madrid beat Real Madrid 2 - 0 in the Copa del Rey last - 16 first leg.\nFernando Torres made his second debut for the club on loan from AC Milan.\nThe 30 - year - old returned an impressive 91 goals during his first spell at the Vicente Calderon.\nThe Spaniard was involved in the game for the first time in the first half.\nTorres was penalised for a foul on Real defender Marcelo Raul Garcia.\nAtleti's first goal came in the second half of the game.\nTorres has returned to the club in a bid to improve form.", "text": "Fernando Torres is back home.

Where athletes come from \"is not an issue,\" he said. \"It is the paperwork.\"\n\n\"Playing athletics is a privilege and not a right,\" said Polansky, adding that it is up to schools to police themselves on student eligibility.\n\nBaron said Delancy first attended a private school, which required an I-20 form. An I-20 is a student visa that gives international students permission to attend school. But Delancy or Krop were not required to provide such a form when he transferred to Krop, a public school, Baron said Tuesday.\n\nDearing said public schools must have such student visa forms and that Delancy's form had expired.\n\nAlthough the athletic association board ruled Delancy ineligible and vacated the school's wins, its decision did not keep Krop out of the playoffs, said Polansky. Each district in Florida decides independently how its sports teams will advance in the post-season.\n\nThe emergency petition that was taken before Eig argued the athletic association never set a hearing or requested information from Delancy before making a \"unilateral\" determination on his eligibility.\n\nDearing disagreed.\n\n\"We have due process in every rule in our book,\" he said, adding it was Krop that asked for a waiver of the normal appeals process in order to get a ruling from the full board.\n\nBaron argues Delancy has always been forthright with the school on his background and should not have to prove his legal status to play.\n\nThe athletic association believes Krop is being \"disingenuous\" about its knowledge and compliance with rules, Dearing said. The school was walked through proper paperwork last year because of another case involving international students, he said.\n\nThe executive director said the athletic association must ensure rules are met.\n\nBaron said he knows that Krop could win it all and then lose the crown if the athletic association ultimately decides Delancy was ineligible and the wins should be forfeited.\n\n\"These kids are only concerned about playing for the championship,\" he said."}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 6, 10, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 4, 12], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Reese Witherspoon was arrested on April 19 after disobeying a police officer's order to stay in the car.\nThe actress was angry after her husband was arrested for DUI after failing a field sobriety test.\nReese's husband, Jim Toth, was handcuffed and charged with disorderly conduct.\nThe one and a half minute film was taken from the patrol car's dash camera and posted on TMZ.", "text": "Video footage has emerged of the moment Reese Witherspoon got into a drunken confrontation with a police office which resulted in her arrest for disorderly conduct.\n\nThe one and a half minute film, taken from the patrol car's dash camera and posted on TMZ, shows Reese slurring and screaming at a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia following her husband Jim Toth's arrest for DUI.\n\nReese was arrested for on April 19 after disobeying an officer's order to stay in the car.\n\nAfter repeated requests from the police officer and her husband to stay quiet, her antagonistic exchange with the police officer ended in her being handcuffed and charged.\n\nFurious: The moment captured on the police car's dash camera which shows Reese Witherspoon (bottom right) arrested for disorderly conduct\n\nIn the video, an agitated Reese attempts to protest after husband Jim was handcuffed after failing a field sobriety test.\n\nThe officer told the actress several times to sit down and stay in the car, much to her chagrin.\n\n'I'm pregnant and I need to use the restroom,' she calls to the officer\n - something she told GMA on Thursday morning was untrue.\n\nSeemingly unable to listen, Reese gets out of the car and begins arguing with the officer who promptly arrests her.\n\nHands behind your back: Reese was enraged at her arrest and accused the officer of harassment\n\nDo you know my name?

This would make them feel knock-backs more deeply \u2013 and so expect bad things to happen more often.\n\nThe finding suggests making enough GABA is crucial to dealing with disappointment.\n\nProfessor Malinow, of the University of California, San Diego, said: \u2018What we have found is a process that may dampen the brain\u2019s sensitivity to negative life events.\u2019\n\nHis research, published in the journal Science, doesn\u2019t just help explain why some people are more pessimistic than others \u2013 it could also help in the search for new treatments for depression."}, {"annotators_ids": [4, 6, 10, 14, 15, 19, 5, 12, 21, 23], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "England have unveiled their new kit for first time against New Zealand.\nThe crimson shirt will be used against Samoa on November 22.\nChris Robshaw will captain England against New Zealand on November 8.\nEngland second row and Canterbury ambassador Geoff Parling is also impressed.\nHe said: 'There is something special about wearing the English rose on your chest'.", "text": "England have unveiled their new kit ahead of the autumn internationals - with the home design to be worn for the first time when Stuart Lancaster's men host the All Blacks on November 8.\n\nThe red rose has been moved to the centre of the shirts for the first time ever, directly above the title sponsor O2, and the 'Test' jersey is available for a hefty \u00a390.

Facebook also recently released 'local awareness' ads that help local business promote themselves to users (pictured right)\n\nEarlier this week, reports said California-based Yahoo (CEO Marissa Mayer shown making her keynote address in January 2014) is planning to invest \u00a312 million ($20 million) in the three year-old tech startup. If true the investment would value the company at \u00a36 billion ($10 billion)\n\nThe move comes after a similar, albeit much larger, investment in Chinese technology firm Alibaba reaped huge dividends for Yahoo, with its $1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThis latest move, according to the Wall Street Journal, comes as Snapchat starts to seek funding from venture-capital firms, money managers and companies.\n\nEarlier this year Instagram  launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt.\n\nThe app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend.\n\nLike Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video.\n\nHowever, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you\u2019re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends.\n\nThe favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total.\n\nBolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world.\n\nSnapchat may be a key partner to Yahoo as it gets set to release Snapchat Discovery next year.\n\nThis is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app, which will likely become a key source of revenue for Snapchat.\n\nSnapchat Discovery would provide a platform for Yahoo to distribute its own content.\n\nHowever, the \u00a36 billion ($10 billion) valuation of a company that hasn't, yet, monetised its users, has been dubbed a risky proposition.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it hasn\u2019t worked before; Microsoft\u2019s 2007 investment in Facebook valued the then three-year old company at \u00a39.4 billion ($15 billion), and later proved hugely successful.\n\nLast year Snapchat infamously turned down a \u00a31.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook - a decision that left many stunned.\n\nBut the move seems to have paid off, as Snapchat\u2019s owners Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company.\n\nIf the valuation holds true, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of \u00a36 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB.\n\nYahoo's move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byer in August this year. Pictured are owners\u00a0Evan Spiegel, left, and Bobby Murphy\n\nSnapchat lets users send photo-messages that vanish within seconds, but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services.\n\nThis may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users.\n\nAlthough Snapchat, and other similar mobile messaging apps, don't have established business models yet, its rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so.\n\nSnapchat is continuing to grow in popularity, with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day.\n\nIn June, Facebook launched a similar app called Slingshot in the hope of replicating Snapchat\u2019s success.\n\nThe app lets consumers exchange photos and videos, which later disappear, without requiring Facebook accounts.\n\nBut despite its rapid growth, Snapchat has had a number of obstacles to contend with.\n\nThe group this year settled charges with US regulators, which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission at the time, photos sent on Snapchat could, in fact, be saved by recipients using several methods, such as taking a screenshot."}, {"annotators_ids": [4, 10, 14, 19, 5, 6, 12, 15, 21, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Crumbs, the New York City - based cupcake shop operator that built its business around cupcakes, shuttered all of its 48 remaining locations Monday.\nExperts say the company's bankruptcy was caused by over - expansion at a time when demand for cupcakes leveled off Krispy Kreme, for instance, expanded rapidly in large part on the cult - like following of its doughnuts.\nMrs. Fields, which is known for its cookies, was down to 230 stores last year, from 438 a decade ago.\nCompanies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks.", "text": "Crumbs Bakery has learned the hard way that building a business on a fad is no cakewalk.\n\nWhen Crumbs, the New York City-based chain that built its business around cupcakes, shuttered all of its 48 remaining locations Monday, it seemed like an abrupt ending for a company that opened a decade ago to ride the wave of popularity of the sugary treat sparked by the TV series Sex and The City.\n\nBut Crumbs' rise and fall isn't surprising when considering the company's dependence on a culinary craze. In fact, it's the latest cautionary tale for businesses that devote their entire menus to variations of a single product.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHarbinger of doom: Crumbs shuttered all its 48 locations a week after the struggling cupcake shop operator was delisted from the Nasdaq\n\nHow Crumbs crumbled: Experts say Crumbs Bakery's bankruptcy was caused by over-expansion at a time when demand for cupcakes leveled off\n\nKrispy Kreme, for instance, expanded rapidly in large part on the cult-like following of its doughnuts. But sales started declining and the company ended up closing some locations.\n\nLast year, restaurant industry researcher Technomic said Krispy Kreme had 249 locations, down from 338 a decade ago. The chain has broadened its menu more recently. Executives at Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary later this week, weren't available for comment.\n\nA similar fate befell Mrs. Fields, which is known for its cookies. The chain has suffered in part because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies, and it was down to 230 stores last year, from 438 a decade ago.\n\nTCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago. Part of the chain's problem is the competition, given the proliferation of frozen yogurt places. A representative for the parent company of Mrs. Fields and TCBY wasn't immediately available.\n\nCompanies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks. For one, trendy products tend to attract competition from big and small players that want to jump on the bandwagon. For instance, Starbucks and Cold Stone Creamery have been trying to capitalize on the cupcake trend with cake pops and ice cream cupcakes, respectively.\n\nWhere it all started: The cupcake craze can be traced back to Sex and the City (pictured), which popularized the frosted mini-cakes sold by Magnolia bakery in the 90s\n\nDiversified: Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies and brownies\n\nBeing beholden to a single item also makes companies more susceptible to customers' whims and changing tastes.\n\nThere's always a new fad: frozen yogurt; chopped salads; freshly squeezed juices, and even gourmet toast. Entrepreneurs may be eager to open stores selling these products, but there's always the danger that fickle customers will move on to the next thing.\n\n'A cupcake shop today can't survive on just cupcakes,' said Darren Tristano, a Technomic analyst.\n\nTo combat the risks, many chains diversify their menus. And several have prospered by moving beyond their flagship products.\n\nDunkin' Donuts, for instance, has been pushing aggressively into specialty drinks and sandwiches, with a focus on boosting sales after its morning rush hour.\n\nAnd Starbucks has introduced a range of new foods and drinks in its cafes, including premium bottled juices and salad boxes. The coffee chain even plans to expand wine and beer offering in evenings to as many as 1,000 locations over the next several years.\n\nMagnolia, another popular New York City cupcake shop, is credited for sparking the cupcake craze after it was featured in Sex and the City.\n\nDownsizing: Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary this week, had 249 locations last year, down from 338 a decade ago\n\nStreamlined: The chain Mrs Fields took a hit  because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies and closed down nearly half of its 438 storefronts\n\nFreeze out: The frozen yogurt business TCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago, because of stiff competition\n\nThe chain, which opened in 1996, has endured while many of the cupcake shops that opened up in its wake \u2014 including Crumbs \u2014 focused on just cupcakes. That's in part because Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies, brownies and banana pudding.\n\nSara Gramling, Magnolia's spokeswoman, said the company is learning about the dangers of focusing too heavily on one product, as well as expanding too quickly.\n\n'We'll be mindful of those lessons,' she said.\n\nStill, some chains manage to persevere by carving out a niche where there aren't many competitors; Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon have expanded locations over the years.\n\nAs for Crumbs, the company noted in a statement late Monday that it was evaluating its 'limited remaining options.' That will include a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Crumbs did not provide comment beyond its statement.\n\nWhile some business analysts were quick to conclude that Crumbs\u2019 collapse heralded the end of the decade-long cupcake trend, others suggested that the bakery chain was a special case.\n\nDecade-long fad: Crumbs first opened its doors in March 2003 in Manhattan. The company went public in 2011 but has been suffering as the cupcake boom has deflated\n\nDavid Sax, author of The Tastemakers: Why We\u2019re Crazy for Cupcakes but Fed Up With Fondue, described Crumbs\u2019 failure as \u2018a classic tale of overexpansion and borrowing too much money,\u2019 adding that it was no indicative of the state of the cupcake industry at large, reported the Washington Post.\n\nIn Sax\u2019s retelling of the story, Crumbs\u2019 fatal flaw was that the chain continued opening more and more stores even as demand for cupcakes levelled off. By 2013, the bakery had 70 locations, which brought in less than $650,000 each.\n\nLast cupcake: Before the Crumbs empire crumbled, employees at Likeable Media in New York City bought this sprinkled cupcake from the now-shuttered shop on 42nd Street for $3.95\n\nFour years earlier, each of Crumbs' 25 locations raked in $1.2million in sales.\n\nSax insisted that the frosted mini-cakes have a bright future.\n\n\u2018This is much more a story about one company\u2019s mismanagement of its product line than it is about the hatred or falling off of one particular American pastry,\u2019 he said. \u2018When the housing market crashed in 2007 or 2008, it wasn\u2019t like people stopped investing in real estate.\n\n\u2018The death of Crumbs doesn\u2019t mean the end of every other cupcake bakery.\u2019\n\nThe news of the chain\u2019s bankruptcy comes less than two weeks after the Nasdaq announced it would stop trading Crumbs, which went public in 2011.\n\nCrumbs had seen a steep decline in profitability since its debut on the market: In its quarterly report from March, the company posted an accumulated deficit of $28.8million.\n\nOutside the Crumbs on 42nd Street, near Times Square, disappointment was palpable Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA pregnancy craving brought Neicy Robinson of the Bronx to another Crumbs location before she walked to the Bryant Park store and realized they had all closed.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.

The nuclear reactor is not what most Vietnamese think of when they think of Dalat. The town, nestled in pine woods, is Vietnam's favorite honeymoon spot.\n\nHighly enriched uranium rods are laid out on a table at the research institute in Dalat, Vietnam.\n\nThe institute is not a romantic place. Located in a cylindrical, concrete building, it contains a 500-kilowatt, pool-type reactor that had only recently been loaded with Soviet WWR-M2 fuel assemblies.\n\nBuilt in 1963 with U.S. help, it originally contained highly enriched uranium from the United States.\n\nIn 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, the reactor was closed, then reconstructed by the Soviet Union. In 1983, it reopened, this time using Soviet highly enriched uranium -- a Cold War marriage made in heaven.\n\nThe institute created medical isotopes and carried out research, but few people if any, in those days thought about the possibility that terrorists might take an interest in the uranium.  Watch experts remove nuclear fuel and show how easily terrorists could hide it \u00bb\n\nAs I was soon to see for myself, fresh, highly enriched uranium is easy to smuggle. When clad with aluminum, its radiation is detectable only by specialized sensors. Approximately 25 kilograms are all that is needed to make a crude nuclear device.\n\nI had never heard of Dalat when, sitting at my desk in Washington last July, I got a call from a contact at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nA dream I had had several years ago, when I was working in Moscow as CNN's bureau chief was about to come true: CNN was given the green light to be the only television network invited to shoot a secret joint U.S./Russian mission to remove the HEU fuel from the Dalat reactor.\n\nThe Vietnamese government, once a U.S. enemy, had agreed to give up its HEU in exchange for converting the reactor to low-enriched uranium that cannot be used for a bomb.\n\nMy contact gave few details over the phone. I went to the Department of Energy for a closed-door briefing.\n\nCNN cameraman Charlie Miller and I would travel to Ho Chi Minh City, where we would meet the Department of Energy staff, then fly to Dalat and drive to the reactor.\n\nAccording to DOE ground rules, we would be able to share only a few details of the operation with our senior editors. The timing of the actual transfer of the HEU was classified. We would learn it only after we had arrived in Vietnam. We would not be able to broadcast our report until the nuclear material was back in Russia.\n\nAfter our arrival in Ho Chi Minh City September 11, we, along with a U.S. and a Japanese newspaper reporter, met the other members of the team: two Russian nuclear experts and a representative from the International Atomic Energy Agency -- the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations -- who were to certify completion of the transfer.\n\nAfter a short flight to Dalat, we loaded into a van and set out on the serpentine road toward the research institute, passing ribbons of Vietnamese on motor scooters, the primary mode of transportation here.\n\nAt the gate, a color poster of Ho Chi Minh greets us. Inside, we don yellow lab coats, cover our shoes with blue throw-away slippers and enter the cavernous room where the reactor stands, towering over us like something out of \"Dr. Strangelove.\"\n\nThe HEU fuel rods have been removed from the reactor and are stored in a large metal case. A Vietnamese scientist fumbles with the keys, then opens the top and begins handing the rods to the Russian experts, who lay them out on a table.\n\nThe experts are wearing dosimeters to measure the radiation, but only one person wears gloves -- simple, rough cotton ones. They hand me a fuel rod and I hold it in my bare hands. Now I understand just how easy it would be for a terrorist to disguise the fact that he or she was carrying highly enriched uranium. The fuel rod looks for all the world like an aluminum leg to a small table.\n\nThe experts lead us up steep metal stairs to the top of the reactor. I peer down into the pool of water into which a technician is lowering new fuel rods made of low-enriched uranium. Unlike highly enriched uranium, this fuel cannot be used to make a bomb.\n\nThe Vietnamese are willing to cooperate, but they also want to verify that this new fuel will work as well as the HEU did. In the control room, they huddle in front of a wall of electronic gauges, waiting until the reactor reaches \"criticality.\"\n\nAs a blue gauge hits the mark, the room fills with applause. Professor Vuong Huu Tan, chairman of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission, tells me \"the most important part of the reactor is training our people in nuclear energy.\"\n\nThis is the other part of the equation: By complying with the U.S./Russian effort to remove vulnerable nuclear materials, Vietnam assures it will get international support for its quest to build nuclear power plants to generate energy. Both U.S. and Russian companies are eyeing Vietnam as a potential market.\n\nThe Russians wrap the fuel rods in plastic, then insert them into two large, steel cylinders. The IAEA expert seals them. If they're tampered with, it will be obvious.\n\nThe next day, a flatbed military truck backs into the reactor room. A crane lifts the cylinders and gently lays them on the truck's wooden bed as a Vietnamese military officer, in olive drab, looks on.\n\nThe final and most vulnerable phase of the operation begins. The truck drives through the reactor gates and joins a convoy guarded by armed soldiers. Sirens blaring, we set out in a slow procession, weaving down the mountain road, traffic police on motorcycles waving riders on motor scooters out of the way.\n\nAt Dalat's airport, the truck wheels onto the tarmac and stops near a Vietnamese military helicopter. A forklift lowers the cylinders to the ground and six soldiers heave them in slings to the helicopter.\n\nFrom there, they are flown to the military base at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where they are put onto a Russian transport plane. Until the last moment, it is unclear whether the Vietnamese military will allow journalists onto the base. As one soldier tells a member of the nuclear team, \"the last time Americans were here was when you bombed us.\"\n\nBut they do let us in. \"No pictures outside. Just inside the plane.\" We climb the stairs into the belly of the Ilyushin 76 and see the two baby-blue cylinders filled with highly enriched uranium, nestled side by side, like two children of the Cold War, ready for a trip back to where they came from: Russia.\n\nAt 2 p.m., right on schedule, the engines roar and the plane lumbers down the runway, off to its ultimate destination in the Ural Mountains. There, the HEU will be blended into a form that cannot be used for bomb-making.\n\nMy instincts tell me to grab a phone and call CNN headquarters in Atlanta to report that the plane has taken off, but the embargo is strict: no broadcast until the HEU is safely back on Russian soil.\n\nOn the sweltering tarmac at a military base in Ho Chi Minh City, as the plane rises in the sky, the team of nuclear experts, the Vietnamese soldiers and even we reporters break into applause. Three countries: Russia, the United States and Vietnam, intertwined in a complex page of history, brought together in a mission to make the world more secure.\n\nThis is the 13th such mission carried out by the United States and Russia. Altogether, a total of 442 kilograms of fresh HEU from 11 countries, enough to build more than 17 crude nuclear devices, have been removed. But there is more to be done. The two countries still are only halfway there in securing vulnerable nuclear materials around the world.

and even suggested that she had not been honest\nin her explanations of the talking points.\n\nShe withdrew herself from \nconsideration only when it became clear that Senators John McCain and \nLinsdey Graham would block her path and instead the post went to John \nKerry.\n\nIt what could be seen as a thumb in \nthe face to some Republicans, her new job is arguably more influential \nthan it would be at the State Department.\n\nShe will have the ear of the \npresident on a daily basis and could potentially advise him on issues \nthat go beyond a foreign policy remit.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice performing her role - it has been announced today that she will take over as President Obama's National Security Advise\n\nThe U.S. Consulate in Benghazi came under terror attack on September 11th 2012 which led to the death of the American ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens\n\nChristopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya died along with three embassy staff on September 11, 2012, as they rushed away from a consulate building in Benghazi\n\nIndeed, what could potentially be \nmore satisfying for Rice is that unlike the Secretary of State role, the\nNational Security Adviser does not require Senate approval.\n\nSenior Republicans reacted in disgust to the appointment of Susan Rice to the position of National Securirty Adviser.\n\nSenator Rand Paul said on Wednesday morning that he couldn't begin to contemplate why she was promoted.\n\n'I can\u2019t imagine, one, that we would be keeping Ambassador Rice in any significant position, much less promoting her to an important position,' Paul (R-Ky.) said on Fox\u2019s 'America\u2019s Newsroom.'\n\n'How will the administration ever have the authority for people to believe what they\u2019re saying, when they\u2019re promoting someone who directly and deliberately misled the public over Benghazi?'\n\nObama will also name Samantha Power, a\nhuman rights expert and former White House adviser, to replace Rice as \nthe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nPower is a respected former journalist who started her career as a 22-year-old freelance reporter in Bosnia - where she developed her staunch opinions on U.S. intervention on moral grounds.\n\nAn armed man holding his rifle as he stands next to buildings set on fire at the US consulate, in Benghazi, Libya, 11 September 2012\n\nIn 2002, Power wrote and published the Pullitzer Prize winning book, 'A Problem from Hell': America and the Age of Genocide' - which led her to be named two years later as one of Time's 110 most influential people in the world.\n\nIn 2008 she joined then Senator Obama's office as a foreign policy adviser but had to step down after she called Hilary Clinton 'a monster' in reported comments she made to the Scotsman newspaper.\n\nFrom 2009 until this February she was serving on the president's National Security Council as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director running the Office of Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights.\n\nPower's husband is Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein, who is a widely admired intellectual and a good friend of President Obama.\n\nThe White House official said Donilon is expected to stay on the job until early July, after Obama wraps up overseas trips to Europe and Africa, as well as an unusual summit in California later this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe official insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the personnel changes before they were publicly announced.\n\nSamantha Power,\u00a0 former Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights at the National Security Council and foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama, emerges from the West Wing of the White House in Washington\n\nDonilon has overseen a foreign policy agenda at the White House that put increased emphasis on the U.S. relationship with Asia.\n\nHe's also played a key role in the administration's counterterrorism strategy, including the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden, and in managing the complex U.S. ties with Russia.\n\nRice, who first started working for Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign, has a close relationship with the president and many of his advisers.\n\nShe's known for being outspoken on human rights issues and also pushed for a more interventionist strategy in Libya."}, {"annotators_ids": [10, 6, 15, 4, 12, 14, 19, 5, 21, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "U.

The nuclear reactor is not what most Vietnamese think of when they think of Dalat. The town, nestled in pine woods, is Vietnam's favorite honeymoon spot.\n\nHighly enriched uranium rods are laid out on a table at the research institute in Dalat, Vietnam.\n\nThe institute is not a romantic place. Located in a cylindrical, concrete building, it contains a 500-kilowatt, pool-type reactor that had only recently been loaded with Soviet WWR-M2 fuel assemblies.\n\nBuilt in 1963 with U.S. help, it originally contained highly enriched uranium from the United States.\n\nIn 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, the reactor was closed, then reconstructed by the Soviet Union. In 1983, it reopened, this time using Soviet highly enriched uranium -- a Cold War marriage made in heaven.\n\nThe institute created medical isotopes and carried out research, but few people if any, in those days thought about the possibility that terrorists might take an interest in the uranium.  Watch experts remove nuclear fuel and show how easily terrorists could hide it \u00bb\n\nAs I was soon to see for myself, fresh, highly enriched uranium is easy to smuggle. When clad with aluminum, its radiation is detectable only by specialized sensors. Approximately 25 kilograms are all that is needed to make a crude nuclear device.\n\nI had never heard of Dalat when, sitting at my desk in Washington last July, I got a call from a contact at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nA dream I had had several years ago, when I was working in Moscow as CNN's bureau chief was about to come true: CNN was given the green light to be the only television network invited to shoot a secret joint U.S./Russian mission to remove the HEU fuel from the Dalat reactor.\n\nThe Vietnamese government, once a U.S. enemy, had agreed to give up its HEU in exchange for converting the reactor to low-enriched uranium that cannot be used for a bomb.\n\nMy contact gave few details over the phone. I went to the Department of Energy for a closed-door briefing.\n\nCNN cameraman Charlie Miller and I would travel to Ho Chi Minh City, where we would meet the Department of Energy staff, then fly to Dalat and drive to the reactor.\n\nAccording to DOE ground rules, we would be able to share only a few details of the operation with our senior editors. The timing of the actual transfer of the HEU was classified. We would learn it only after we had arrived in Vietnam. We would not be able to broadcast our report until the nuclear material was back in Russia.\n\nAfter our arrival in Ho Chi Minh City September 11, we, along with a U.S. and a Japanese newspaper reporter, met the other members of the team: two Russian nuclear experts and a representative from the International Atomic Energy Agency -- the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations -- who were to certify completion of the transfer.\n\nAfter a short flight to Dalat, we loaded into a van and set out on the serpentine road toward the research institute, passing ribbons of Vietnamese on motor scooters, the primary mode of transportation here.\n\nAt the gate, a color poster of Ho Chi Minh greets us. Inside, we don yellow lab coats, cover our shoes with blue throw-away slippers and enter the cavernous room where the reactor stands, towering over us like something out of \"Dr. Strangelove.\"\n\nThe HEU fuel rods have been removed from the reactor and are stored in a large metal case. A Vietnamese scientist fumbles with the keys, then opens the top and begins handing the rods to the Russian experts, who lay them out on a table.\n\nThe experts are wearing dosimeters to measure the radiation, but only one person wears gloves -- simple, rough cotton ones. They hand me a fuel rod and I hold it in my bare hands. Now I understand just how easy it would be for a terrorist to disguise the fact that he or she was carrying highly enriched uranium. The fuel rod looks for all the world like an aluminum leg to a small table.\n\nThe experts lead us up steep metal stairs to the top of the reactor. I peer down into the pool of water into which a technician is lowering new fuel rods made of low-enriched uranium. Unlike highly enriched uranium, this fuel cannot be used to make a bomb.\n\nThe Vietnamese are willing to cooperate, but they also want to verify that this new fuel will work as well as the HEU did. In the control room, they huddle in front of a wall of electronic gauges, waiting until the reactor reaches \"criticality.\"\n\nAs a blue gauge hits the mark, the room fills with applause. Professor Vuong Huu Tan, chairman of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission, tells me \"the most important part of the reactor is training our people in nuclear energy.\"\n\nThis is the other part of the equation: By complying with the U.S./Russian effort to remove vulnerable nuclear materials, Vietnam assures it will get international support for its quest to build nuclear power plants to generate energy. Both U.S. and Russian companies are eyeing Vietnam as a potential market.\n\nThe Russians wrap the fuel rods in plastic, then insert them into two large, steel cylinders. The IAEA expert seals them. If they're tampered with, it will be obvious.\n\nThe next day, a flatbed military truck backs into the reactor room. A crane lifts the cylinders and gently lays them on the truck's wooden bed as a Vietnamese military officer, in olive drab, looks on.\n\nThe final and most vulnerable phase of the operation begins. The truck drives through the reactor gates and joins a convoy guarded by armed soldiers. Sirens blaring, we set out in a slow procession, weaving down the mountain road, traffic police on motorcycles waving riders on motor scooters out of the way.\n\nAt Dalat's airport, the truck wheels onto the tarmac and stops near a Vietnamese military helicopter. A forklift lowers the cylinders to the ground and six soldiers heave them in slings to the helicopter.\n\nFrom there, they are flown to the military base at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where they are put onto a Russian transport plane. Until the last moment, it is unclear whether the Vietnamese military will allow journalists onto the base. As one soldier tells a member of the nuclear team, \"the last time Americans were here was when you bombed us.\"\n\nBut they do let us in. \"No pictures outside. Just inside the plane.\" We climb the stairs into the belly of the Ilyushin 76 and see the two baby-blue cylinders filled with highly enriched uranium, nestled side by side, like two children of the Cold War, ready for a trip back to where they came from: Russia.\n\nAt 2 p.m., right on schedule, the engines roar and the plane lumbers down the runway, off to its ultimate destination in the Ural Mountains. There, the HEU will be blended into a form that cannot be used for bomb-making.\n\nMy instincts tell me to grab a phone and call CNN headquarters in Atlanta to report that the plane has taken off, but the embargo is strict: no broadcast until the HEU is safely back on Russian soil.\n\nOn the sweltering tarmac at a military base in Ho Chi Minh City, as the plane rises in the sky, the team of nuclear experts, the Vietnamese soldiers and even we reporters break into applause. Three countries: Russia, the United States and Vietnam, intertwined in a complex page of history, brought together in a mission to make the world more secure.\n\nThis is the 13th such mission carried out by the United States and Russia. Altogether, a total of 442 kilograms of fresh HEU from 11 countries, enough to build more than 17 crude nuclear devices, have been removed. But there is more to be done. The two countries still are only halfway there in securing vulnerable nuclear materials around the world.

She was able to park her bus, but she kept feeling worse.\n\nThe pain \"went right up my arm and into my chest, and I said, 'Uh-oh, I'm having a heart attack,' \" she said.\n\nThe teacher ran from the bus to get help. Newton South's nurse, Gail Kramer, and CPR instructor Michelle Coppola arrived moments later with the school's new automated external defibrillator.\n\nGeraghty, barely conscious, was fading fast. She was weak and having trouble breathing. And then she went into full cardiac arrest.\n\n\"Her eyes were wide, and all of a sudden she stopped talking to us,\" Coppola said. \"I grabbed the two pads, stuck them on her, started it up, and I'd say within 20 seconds, she had her first shock.\"\n\nCoppola and Kramer performed CPR while they waited for paramedics.  See an expert give a quick lesson in CPR \u00bb\n\nAt that point, Geraghty says, her body died. She remembers watching the scene unfold -- as if from above.\n\n\"I floated right out of my body.

And then they floated away.\"\n\nNext, she says, she was overwhelmed by \"massive energy, powerful, very powerful energy.\"\n\n\"When that was happening, there were pictures of my son and my daughter and my granddaughter, and every second, their pictures flashed in my mind, and then I came back.\"\n\nWhat Geraghty had was a near-death experience, fairly common in people who go into sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nGeraghty was down for 57 minutes. No blood pressure, no pulse, no oxygen, no blood flow. She was shocked 21 times before she finally came back with tales of the afterlife.\n\nAccording to the Near Death Experience Research Foundation, nearly 800 near-death experiences happen every day in the United States.\n\nDr. Kevin Nelson, a neurologist in Lexington, Kentucky, studies near-death experiences and says they're not imagined. The explanation, he says, lies in the brain itself.\n\n\"These are real experiences. And they're experiences that happen at a time of medical crisis and danger,\" Nelson said.\n\nHumans have a lot of reflexes that help keep us alive, part of the \"fight or flight\" response that arises when we're confronted with danger.\n\nNelson thinks that near-death experiences are part of the dream mechanism and that the person having the experience is in a REM, or \"rapid eye movement,\" state.\n\n\"Part of our 'fight or flight' reflexes to keep us alive includes the switch into the REM state of consciousness,\" he said.\n\nDuring REM sleep, there is increased brain activity and visual stimulation. Intense dreaming occurs as a result.\n\nAnd the bright light so many people claim to see?\n\n\"The activation of the visual system caused by REM is causing the bright lights,\" Nelson said.\n\nAnd the tunnel people speak of, he says, is lack of blood flow to the eye. \"The eye, the retina of the eye, is one of the most exquisitely sensitive tissues to a loss of blood flow. So when blood flow does not reach the eye, vision fails, and darkness ensues from the periphery to the center. And that is very likely causing the tunnel effect.\"\n\nNelson is doing studies now to prove that the same effect results from fainting.\n\n\"The most common cause of near-death experience in my research group is fainting. Upwards of 100 million Americans have fainted. That means probably tens of millions of Americans have had these unusual experiences.\"\n\nBut Geraghty says this was no dream. \"I know I went someplace else. I know I went someplace else other than here.\"\n\nDr. Bill O'Callahan, the emergency room doctor who shocked her back to life, agrees. \"Cynics out there would say and agnostics would say that's phenomenon that comes from a dying brain. I think that's hogwash. I firmly believe that people experience these events.\" Cheating Death: Back from the dead\n\nBob Schriever, co-founder of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association, was refereeing a high school football game seven years ago when he went into cardiac arrest, died and was revived.\n\nHe, too, questions the dream explanation. \"Why are so many people dreaming the same thing? How can so many people, and there's hundreds of thousands of people who have experienced this, how can we all be dreaming the same thing and describe the exact same thing?\"\n\nSchriever says these experiences are so profound that only someone who has gone through them can truly understand.\n\nSeven years later, he is still consumed with his own near-death experience.\n\n\"I think about that every morning when I wake up, first thing, during the day, I don't know how many times and every night before I fall asleep. I think about that. People do not understand or appreciate what we go through.\" Scientist uses poison gas to suspend life\n\nFor Geraghty, it's a daily struggle to put the pieces back together again.\n\n\"I've been someplace that not everybody can go, and there's not a lot of people you can sit down and have that conversation with,\" Geraghty said. \"My own daughter tells me, 'It's freaky, Mom.' I've literally lost friends over this the minute they hear it.\" Tweet your own experience and you could win a copy of \"Cheating Death\"\n\nGeraghty says she became depressed once she left the hospital because her perspective on her entire life changed. She still gets depressed, she says, and is on medication.\n\n\"I actually went to my doctor and said to her, 'I think I'm losing my mind. This can't be really happening,' you know, and she said it's OK, it's very hard to understand when you've been through an experience like that.\"\n\nGeraghty has joined the cardiac arrest group, hoping that connecting with others who understand what she's been through will allow her to come to terms with what happened to her that cool spring day six months ago.

Yet somehow it captured the swaggering audacity of the project which saw the two most celebrated athletes on the planet fight for the richest prize in sport in the small hours of a Kinshasa morning.\n\nMuhammad Ali looks on after knocking down George Foreman in the so-called Rumble in the Jungle\n\nOctober 30, 1974: Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman.\n\nThe heavyweight title was at stake, and the world was captivated.\n\nThe fight was made possible by the President of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, a deeply corrupt human rights abuser, who systematically exploited the nation formerly known as the Congo for more than 30 years. Mobutu paid more than $10million to promote his own image. It was then an unimaginable sum, far more than fighters had ever commanded. But then, he was hiring the very best.\n\nAli was 32 years old and was attempting to regain the title he had lost to Ken Norton more than a year earlier.\n\nAlthough many shared his own opinion that he was the greatest \u2018of ahhhhhl tahm!\u2019, they also suspected that he was past his peak, that after 46 fights his talents were eroding.\n\nAli was brought to Zaire for the fight by the infamous President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko\n\nAli trains in front of a captive audience in\u00a0Kinshasa before a cut to Foreman's eye delayed the fight\n\nAbove and beyond all this lay a widespread conviction that the 25-year-old Foreman was genuinely invincible, a monster, one of the most terrifying punchers the sport had known. He had won the title with a murderous dismantling of Joe Frazier, and he saw Ali as his lucrative victim.\n\n\u2018My opponents don\u2019t worry about losing,\u2019 he said. \u2018They worry about getting hurt.\u2019 It was as near as this malevolent, taciturn presence ever came to humour.\n\nBy dazzling contrast, Ali was a force of nature; bright, funny, endlessly personable and dauntingly handsome.\n\nSomebody once wrote of a fabled heavyweight: \u2018Joe Louis was a newspaperman\u2019s champion. He always finished in time for the first edition, so the guys could get to the bar before closing.\u2019\n\nAli will forever be remembered as the greatest heavyweight boxer in history, but the sport took its toll\n\nAli took a lot of punishment by methodically drawing Foreman in to waste the younger fighter's energy\n\n60,000 roaring fans packed Kinshasa\u2019s outdoor Stade du 20 Mai for the fight.\n\n32 -year-old Ali was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds. It is said that in the dressing room, Foreman and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill Ali.\n\n450 locations in the United States and Canada \u2014 and in some cinemas in the United Kingdom \u2014 screened the fight on closed-circuit television.\n\n100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight, which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in Zaire to accommodate audiences in the US.\n\n10 million dollars was split between the two \u2014 $5m each \u2014 paid for by President Mobutu.\n\n45 Foreman first quit in 1977 and returned in the early Nineties \u2014 winning the world title again at 45, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history.\n\nPerhaps so. But when Ali started to paint his word-pictures, he made the bar seem a poor alternative. Before the Foreman fight, he ran through his repertoire.\n\nHe was contemptuous: \u2018Foreman\u2019s a big old bully from Texas who used to beat up people on the streets.\u2019\n\nHe was dismissive: \u2018Foreman hits hard, sure. But hitting power don\u2019t mean nothing if you can\u2019t find nothing to hit.\u2019\n\nHe spouted yards of his terrible poetry: \u2018You think the world was shocked when Nixon resigned?/Wait till I whup George Foreman\u2019s behind.\u2019 And, right across the world, the public lapped it up.\n\nThere was a false start when a sparring partner\u2019s elbow cut Foreman\u2019s eye and both fighters were required to remain in Zaire for a month while Foreman recovered.\n\nAli spent much of the time storming around town and leading the locals in chants of \u2018Ali, bomaye!\u2019 (Ali, kill him!).\n\nFinally, on October 30, 1974, in the Stade du 20 Mai, before 60,000 people, a bell sounded and a fight began.\n\nAli had the locals in Zaire chanting 'Ali, bomaye', which translated means 'Ali, kill him!'\n\nAli begins returning the heavyweight champion of the world's blows with interest\n\nThe legend has grown, these past 40 years, that Ali offered himself as a target, that he simply lay on the ropes and allowed Foreman to punch himself out.\n\nThe promotional poster for the Rumble in the Jungle\n\nWell, up to a point. Watching the fight through once again this week, it could be seen that for calculated spells, Ali encouraged Foreman to throw those scything punches, most of which were deflected by arms and gloves. But time and again he would cut loose from the ropes with bewildering combinations to the head.\n\nForeman grew increasingly confused, unbearably weary. And all the time, Ali talked to him: \u2018You was sp\u2019osed to be bad, George! Show me something! That all you got, sucker? An\u2019 you gettin\u2019 tired, George. Ain\u2019t no place to get tired ...\u2019\u00a0And then, in the dying seconds of round eight, Ali found the energy and strength to throw the conclusive combination, and Foreman simply crumpled, exhausted, to the floor.\n\nI recall the London cinema erupting in joy and relief as the count finished and the aisles were awash with dancing, jostling figures.\n\nAli had that effect; neutrality was not an option. I remember walking out into the Leicester Square dawn, and thinking I should never see anything quite like that again. And I never did.\n\nHe would have a third fight with Frazier, a vicious battle in which both men inflicted enduring mental and physical damage.\n\nThen, as his resistance began to dissolve, every contest became an ordeal.\n\nForeman puts up his guard as Ali surges forward in what has been described as 'The Match of the Century'\n\nReferee Zack Clayton counts out foreman after Ali puts him on the canvass in the 8th round\n\nOn October 2, 1980, in a casino car park in Las Vegas, I squirmed at ringside as Ali, old beyond his 38 years, was cruelly punished by Larry Holmes.\n\nHe took punch after pounding punch to his unprotected head, but his perverse pride would not allow him to fall. So he stood and accepted his punishment, and the odious leeches who had taken his money and bathed in his glory simply shrugged and moved on.\n\nThe illness which would ultimately devour him took hold. The speech grew slower and thicker, the reactions ponderous, the decline precipitous.\n\nAs his condition became more distressing, it provoked serious moral questions about our readiness to condone such licensed barbarity. After all, if the very best of them could suffer such an excruciating fate, how can boxing hope to protect those who have only their courage to commend them? For many of us, the answer was all too obvious.\n\nAli staged three fights with the legendary Joe Frazier, which left both men physically and mentally damaged\n\nAli's brash style changed the way that sportsmen behaved, although few have backed their arrogance with genius\n\nAli left a tangled legacy. Effectively, he legitimised boasting and strident self-praise. Before Ali, sporting modesty was mandatory; you were diffident in victory, gracious in defeat.\n\nAfter Ali, across all our major sports, the old rules fell into disuse.\n\nWe now see an ordinary footballer celebrate a goal, or a journeyman cricketer a wicket, and all too easily we summon up a vision of a brash young man from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nBut the fact that routinely escapes the capering imposters is that the young man happened to be a genius. For once, it is not too inflated a term to describe what he did and how he did it.\n\nIn this anniversary week, as Ali\u2019s condition grows increasingly hazardous, I shall recall the words of George Foreman, when he made a visit to London two or three years ago.\n\nForeman had escaped the fate which befell Ali. He was in robust health, and he was enjoying unprecedented riches, having lent his name to a hugely successful fat-free grill.\n\nAli was stubbornly punished by Larry Holmes in his final fight in Las Vegas, 1980\n\nDespite losing the most memorable fight in history, Foreman still holds the highest respect for his tormentor\n\nBut he remembered his old opponent, warmly and without rancour.\n\n\u2018People think they know about him, but they don\u2019t appreciate just what a fighter he was\u2019, he said. \u2018I mean, I was pretty good. But Muhammad, he was something else.\u2019\n\nFoolishly, I asked if he could imagine another Ali emerging in this generation or the next.\n\n\u2018You mean, will we ever see anybody like that guy again? he asked.\n\nHe gave a small, pitying smile and said nothing. Some questions really don\u2019t deserve an answer."}, {"annotators_ids": [19, 6, 10, 15, 21, 4, 5, 12, 14, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Yasser Arafat died in November 2004 in a Paris hospital from a mystery illness.\nArafat's widow Suha Arafat says her husband's body should be exhumed.\nPolonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen and bone marrow.\nThough it takes 5-6 weeks to affect most, the symptoms of Polonium poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko, who fell ill the day after he was exposed.\nBochud said the only way to confirm findings would be to exhume body.", "text": "Conspiracy: Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital from a mystery illness in 2004\n\nThe body of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may be exhumed over claims he was assassinated with a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority has agreed to \nthe exhumation of his body from a mausoleum in Ramallah on the West Bank\nso the claim can be investigated.\n\nArafat died in 2004 from a mystery illness, amid theories that he was killed at the hands of Israeli spy agency Mossad.\n\nBut a new investigation has concluded that a urine stain on Arafat's underwear had traces of Polonium-210, the highly radioactive substance which killed Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko six years ago.\n\nThe 75-year-old's widow, Suha \nArafat, has called for her late husband's body to be exhumed after the \nAl Jazeera investigation found the traces on clothes he wore in\nhis final days.\n\nPrevious theories had speculated that \nArafat, who died in a Paris hospital in November 2004, had contracted \ncancer, cirrhosis, or even HIV.\n\nBut tests carried out by the Institute\nde Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, showed that Arafat's \nunderwear registered a level of 180 millibecquerels of Polonium-210, \nmore than 20 times the dose to kill an average human being.\n\nDr Francois Bochod, the director of \nthe institute, confirmed to Al Jazeera that there had been an \n'unexplained, elevated amount' of polonium found on the former leader.\n\nThe Al Jazeera documentary revealed that Polonium was found on Arafat's underwear, kaffiyeh headscarf, and even his toothbrush.\n\nAl Jazeera had sent Arafat's clothes \nto the institute to test them, after obtaining them from his widow as \npart of a nine-month investigation into his death.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nInvestigation: Arafat's widow Suha Arafat, pictured here alongside then Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nabil Shaath (left) and then French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin, says her husband's body should be exhumed following the lab results\n\nMany have speculated that Arafat, whose West Bank grave is pictured here, was killed by an Israeli spy agency\n\nThose exposed to a lethal dose of Polonium, usually by ingesting it, die within 2-3 months.\n\nIn most cases there are no serious symptoms for a week after being exposed, but nausea and fatigue would set in soon after.\n\nIn theory, just a microgram of Polonium - the same as a spec of dust - is enough to kill someone, due to its slowly-excreted alpha particles which affect the body's organs.\n\nAfter ingestion, Polonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract.\n\nSerious illness would not be expected for a month, due to the amount of time it takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures.\n\nAs the severity of the exposure develops in the body, victims usually lose hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed.\n\nThis later leads to severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, loss of fluids, and disturbance of electrolyte balance.\n\nThough it takes 5-6 weeks to seriously affect most, the symptoms of Polonium poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko (above), who fell ill the day after he was exposed.\n\nThe Russian died 23 days after being exposed, an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage.\n\nBochud said the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210.\n\n'But we have to do it quite fast because \npolonium is decaying, so if we wait too long, for sure, any possible \nproof will disappear,' he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIt emerged today that Palestinians are ready to accept a medical examination of Arafat's body if his family agrees, according to a Palestinian official.\n\nThe comments from Tawfiq Tirawi, who led a Palestinian probe into Arafat's death, came just hours after the Al-Jazeera investigation showed the Palestinian leader might have been poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium.\n\nThe official told AP: 'After the Al-Jazeera broadcast I met today with president (Mahmud) Abbas and recommended accepting an analysis of the body of the martyr president Arafat, and Abbas for his part agreed on the condition that the family... accepts.'\n\nPolonium was found to have caused the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, and he was assumed to have been deliberately poisoned.\n\nArafat's widow Suha said she would ask for Arafat's body - buried in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian self-rule authority - to be exhumed.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the documentary, aired on Al Jazeera's English and Arabic channels, she said: 'We have to go further and exhume Yasser Arafat's body to reveal the truth to all the Muslim and Arab world.'\n\nArafat led the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's fight against Israel from the 1960s but signed a peace agreement with the Jewish state in 1993 establishing Palestinian self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nHis mysterious death came four years into a Palestinian uprising, after years of talks with Israel failed to lead to a Palestinian state.\n\nFrench doctors who treated Arafat in his final days could not establish the cause of death.\n\nFrench officials refused to give details of his condition, citing privacy laws, fuelling a host of rumours and theories over the nature of his illness."}, {"annotators_ids": [12, 15, 6, 19, 4, 5, 10, 14, 23, 21], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "13 plaintiffs, including four U.

It was true.\n\nThat was in July, 2008 and he had just signed for Newcastle from Real Mallorca. I interviewed him at the club\u2019s training ground and there was no need for an interpreter, Jonas insisting from the off that he used English.\n\nNewcastle's Jonas Gutierrez has been battling testicular cancer and the chemotherapy has caused hair loss\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is his gregarious nature, he\u2019s larger than life but endearing and infectious with it.\n\nIt was, then, a shock to learn of his battle with testicular cancer and to see the TV interview in which Jonas \u2013 wearing a baseball cap having lost his hair following chemotherapy \u2013 revealed his illness.\n\nFor while we all know that cancer does not discriminate, here was a supreme athlete once nicknamed El Galgo \u2013 The Greyhound \u2013 for his indefatigable efforts on the field.\n\nBut when he arrived at Newcastle it was the moniker \u2018Spiderman\u2019 we were all talking about.\n\nDuring his time at Mallorca, Jonas, after a visit to the cinema to see Spiderman, had promised a boy he would don the superhero\u2019s mask the next time he scored a goal.\n\nAnd so he duly did, producing the disguise from his shorts following a solo strike against Osasuna.\n\nThe Argentine midfielder is known for his gregarious, larger-than-life personality that is hard to dislike\n\nType \u2018Spidey Jonas\u2019 into YouTube and enjoy it for yourselves, you\u2019ll see what I mean about his fun-loving nature from the celebration as he mimics spinning a web.\n\nOne person who certainly thought Jonas was a superhero was my own mam.

It was then that we realised her shoe was caught in the drain on the fringe of the pitch. Without further notice Jonas was down on all fours manoeuvring the shoe back and forth in a bid to free it. Thirty seconds and two more kisses later we were all on our way. He\u2019d even signed the matchday programmes of which he was the cover star.\n\nIn fact, I have never seen Jonas refuse an autograph or an interview. His willingness to engage with team-mates, press and supporters made him instantly popular on Tyneside.\n\nGutierrez was loaned out to Norwich last season but they were relegated from the Premier League\n\nHe backed it up on a Saturday afternoon as well. He was so impressive on his debut at Manchester United \u2013 a 1-1 draw \u2013 that Alan Hansen said on Match of the Day that he could be the signing of the season.\n\nSadly, with Keegan gone before the month was out, Newcastle were ultimately relegated. Gutierrez, though, stayed and played a key role in the club regaining their top-flight status \u2013 there was also the long-awaited appearance of the Spiderman mask at St James\u2019 Park following a fine goal against Peterborough.

'The issue with gender and women featured more prominently in Australia's role in the war that it did in other countries.'\n\n60,000 Australian lives were lost in battle, which meant one in ten men who was sent overseas never returned home. Hundreds of thousands more came back as casualties of war, with serious physical and debilitating mental scars.\n\n'The [initial] rush to enlist was in light of they thought it would be a war that would be over so quickly.'

While it was common for women to assume different roles in absence of the men, Australian women had less opportunity to actively participate in the war.\n\nProfessor Macintyre revealed: 'There were many patriotic women who wanted to play a part but found it difficult to do so.' Unlike in WWII where women had the chance to carry rifles, during WWI mothers and wives fell into 'comfort' roles.\n\nThey worked for charities in volunteer roles - collecting funds for soldier's relief, and knitted socks and balaclavas to send to the troops. ANZAC biscuits and tobacco were also gifted to those fighting.\n\nAs they didn't have the opportunity to actively participate in the war, women found other ways to throw their support behind the troops\n\nWives and mothers assumed what were known as comfort roles during WWI while looking after the household and children\n\nMore than 60,000 Australian men lost their lives during battle, pictured here are soldiers in Liverpool, NSW before they departed\n\nWomen enjoyed a greater sense of autonomy within society while scores of men were on the battlefields\n\nIn the home the women stepped up into traditionally male roles, and had a greater sense of autonomy within society.\n\n'In many households women took the dual role of mother and head of the household in the absence of men', Professor Macintyre said.

Muhammad Ali is gravely ill. Parkinson\u2019s Syndrome, the brutal legacy of his 21 years in the professional ring, has tightened its hold and, at 72, there are signs that his battle may soon be over.\n\nIn time, many will attempt to assess the career of the most dramatically gifted and socially significant sportsman who ever lived. But in the week ahead, we shall concentrate on the 40th anniversary of his most extraordinary achievement.\n\n\u2018The Rumble in the Jungle\u2019 sounds like one of those promotional slogans which emerge from a three-bottle lunch. Yet somehow it captured the swaggering audacity of the project which saw the two most celebrated athletes on the planet fight for the richest prize in sport in the small hours of a Kinshasa morning.\n\nMuhammad Ali looks on after knocking down George Foreman in the so-called Rumble in the Jungle\n\nOctober 30, 1974: Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman.\n\nThe heavyweight title was at stake, and the world was captivated.\n\nThe fight was made possible by the President of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, a deeply corrupt human rights abuser, who systematically exploited the nation formerly known as the Congo for more than 30 years. Mobutu paid more than $10million to promote his own image. It was then an unimaginable sum, far more than fighters had ever commanded. But then, he was hiring the very best.\n\nAli was 32 years old and was attempting to regain the title he had lost to Ken Norton more than a year earlier.\n\nAlthough many shared his own opinion that he was the greatest \u2018of ahhhhhl tahm!\u2019, they also suspected that he was past his peak, that after 46 fights his talents were eroding.\n\nAli was brought to Zaire for the fight by the infamous President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko\n\nAli trains in front of a captive audience in\u00a0Kinshasa before a cut to Foreman's eye delayed the fight\n\nAbove and beyond all this lay a widespread conviction that the 25-year-old Foreman was genuinely invincible, a monster, one of the most terrifying punchers the sport had known. He had won the title with a murderous dismantling of Joe Frazier, and he saw Ali as his lucrative victim.\n\n\u2018My opponents don\u2019t worry about losing,\u2019 he said. \u2018They worry about getting hurt.\u2019 It was as near as this malevolent, taciturn presence ever came to humour.\n\nBy dazzling contrast, Ali was a force of nature; bright, funny, endlessly personable and dauntingly handsome.\n\nSomebody once wrote of a fabled heavyweight: \u2018Joe Louis was a newspaperman\u2019s champion. He always finished in time for the first edition, so the guys could get to the bar before closing.\u2019\n\nAli will forever be remembered as the greatest heavyweight boxer in history, but the sport took its toll\n\nAli took a lot of punishment by methodically drawing Foreman in to waste the younger fighter's energy\n\n60,000 roaring fans packed Kinshasa\u2019s outdoor Stade du 20 Mai for the fight.\n\n32 -year-old Ali was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds. It is said that in the dressing room, Foreman and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill Ali.\n\n450 locations in the United States and Canada \u2014 and in some cinemas in the United Kingdom \u2014 screened the fight on closed-circuit television.\n\n100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight, which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in Zaire to accommodate audiences in the US.\n\n10 million dollars was split between the two \u2014 $5m each \u2014 paid for by President Mobutu.\n\n45 Foreman first quit in 1977 and returned in the early Nineties \u2014 winning the world title again at 45, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history.\n\nPerhaps so. But when Ali started to paint his word-pictures, he made the bar seem a poor alternative. Before the Foreman fight, he ran through his repertoire.\n\nHe was contemptuous: \u2018Foreman\u2019s a big old bully from Texas who used to beat up people on the streets.\u2019\n\nHe was dismissive: \u2018Foreman hits hard, sure. But hitting power don\u2019t mean nothing if you can\u2019t find nothing to hit.\u2019\n\nHe spouted yards of his terrible poetry: \u2018You think the world was shocked when Nixon resigned?/Wait till I whup George Foreman\u2019s behind.\u2019 And, right across the world, the public lapped it up.\n\nThere was a false start when a sparring partner\u2019s elbow cut Foreman\u2019s eye and both fighters were required to remain in Zaire for a month while Foreman recovered.\n\nAli spent much of the time storming around town and leading the locals in chants of \u2018Ali, bomaye!\u2019 (Ali, kill him!).\n\nFinally, on October 30, 1974, in the Stade du 20 Mai, before 60,000 people, a bell sounded and a fight began.\n\nAli had the locals in Zaire chanting 'Ali, bomaye', which translated means 'Ali, kill him!'\n\nAli begins returning the heavyweight champion of the world's blows with interest\n\nThe legend has grown, these past 40 years, that Ali offered himself as a target, that he simply lay on the ropes and allowed Foreman to punch himself out.\n\nThe promotional poster for the Rumble in the Jungle\n\nWell, up to a point. Watching the fight through once again this week, it could be seen that for calculated spells, Ali encouraged Foreman to throw those scything punches, most of which were deflected by arms and gloves. But time and again he would cut loose from the ropes with bewildering combinations to the head.\n\nForeman grew increasingly confused, unbearably weary. And all the time, Ali talked to him: \u2018You was sp\u2019osed to be bad, George! Show me something! That all you got, sucker? An\u2019 you gettin\u2019 tired, George. Ain\u2019t no place to get tired ...\u2019\u00a0And then, in the dying seconds of round eight, Ali found the energy and strength to throw the conclusive combination, and Foreman simply crumpled, exhausted, to the floor.\n\nI recall the London cinema erupting in joy and relief as the count finished and the aisles were awash with dancing, jostling figures.\n\nAli had that effect; neutrality was not an option. I remember walking out into the Leicester Square dawn, and thinking I should never see anything quite like that again. And I never did.\n\nHe would have a third fight with Frazier, a vicious battle in which both men inflicted enduring mental and physical damage.\n\nThen, as his resistance began to dissolve, every contest became an ordeal.\n\nForeman puts up his guard as Ali surges forward in what has been described as 'The Match of the Century'\n\nReferee Zack Clayton counts out foreman after Ali puts him on the canvass in the 8th round\n\nOn October 2, 1980, in a casino car park in Las Vegas, I squirmed at ringside as Ali, old beyond his 38 years, was cruelly punished by Larry Holmes.\n\nHe took punch after pounding punch to his unprotected head, but his perverse pride would not allow him to fall. So he stood and accepted his punishment, and the odious leeches who had taken his money and bathed in his glory simply shrugged and moved on.\n\nThe illness which would ultimately devour him took hold. The speech grew slower and thicker, the reactions ponderous, the decline precipitous.\n\nAs his condition became more distressing, it provoked serious moral questions about our readiness to condone such licensed barbarity. After all, if the very best of them could suffer such an excruciating fate, how can boxing hope to protect those who have only their courage to commend them? For many of us, the answer was all too obvious.\n\nAli staged three fights with the legendary Joe Frazier, which left both men physically and mentally damaged\n\nAli's brash style changed the way that sportsmen behaved, although few have backed their arrogance with genius\n\nAli left a tangled legacy. Effectively, he legitimised boasting and strident self-praise. Before Ali, sporting modesty was mandatory; you were diffident in victory, gracious in defeat.\n\nAfter Ali, across all our major sports, the old rules fell into disuse.\n\nWe now see an ordinary footballer celebrate a goal, or a journeyman cricketer a wicket, and all too easily we summon up a vision of a brash young man from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nBut the fact that routinely escapes the capering imposters is that the young man happened to be a genius. For once, it is not too inflated a term to describe what he did and how he did it.\n\nIn this anniversary week, as Ali\u2019s condition grows increasingly hazardous, I shall recall the words of George Foreman, when he made a visit to London two or three years ago.\n\nForeman had escaped the fate which befell Ali. He was in robust health, and he was enjoying unprecedented riches, having lent his name to a hugely successful fat-free grill.\n\nAli was stubbornly punished by Larry Holmes in his final fight in Las Vegas, 1980\n\nDespite losing the most memorable fight in history, Foreman still holds the highest respect for his tormentor\n\nBut he remembered his old opponent, warmly and without rancour.\n\n\u2018People think they know about him, but they don\u2019t appreciate just what a fighter he was\u2019, he said. \u2018I mean, I was pretty good. But Muhammad, he was something else.\u2019\n\nFoolishly, I asked if he could imagine another Ali emerging in this generation or the next.\n\n\u2018You mean, will we ever see anybody like that guy again? he asked.\n\nHe gave a small, pitying smile and said nothing. Some questions really don\u2019t deserve an answer."}, {"annotators_ids": [14, 15, 4, 6, 10, 19, 21, 23, 5, 12], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], "summary": "Kate Rothschild, mother - of - three, is heiress to one of the world's most illustrious banking dynasties.\nShe was happy to describe herself as a housewife in 2005.\nNow she is a rock chick, hanging out with rappers.\nJay Electronica has a daughter by a previous relationship and a penchant for marijuana and Jack Daniels.\nThe Rothschilds were married to Ben Goldsmith in April 2013.\nHe was worth cc300 million ; his bride a relatively paltry Nottinghamshire8 million.\nNow, her marriage destroyed, she spends her life trying to control a rapper.", "text": "Pulling hard on a cigarette as she sauntered down the road, the unkempt brunette in the hoodie barely drew a glance from photographers outside Ronnie Scott\u2019s nightclub in Soho last week.\n\nThe flashbulbs duly exploded into action for Kate Moss, Noel Gallagher, Stephen Fry and many more.

Everyone had been hoping that things would settle down, but she is increasingly out of reach. Fundamentally, she is a wonderful girl with a sensible head on her shoulders. She\u2019s also a great mum. But there is a wild, creative side which has a tendency to give everyone around her sleepless nights.\n\n\u2018From what I hear of the events the other day, they made quite a spectacle of themselves. What was she thinking?\u2019\n\nIndeed, Kate Rothschild\u2019s life has undergone a total transformation since 2005, when she was happy to describe herself as a housewife. Now she is a rock chick, hanging out with rappers.\n\nIt is certainly hard to believe that \nTuesday\u2019s apparition is the stunning girl who lit up the gossip columns a\n decade ago in the society wedding of the year.\n\nThe marriage of of Ben Goldsmith and Kate Rothschild ended in divorce in April 2013. Kate, then 21, was a vision of understated beauty as she wed Ben bringing together two of Britain's most fabulously wealthy dynasties\n\nKate, then 21, was a vision of understated beauty with flowers in her hair as she wed Ben Goldsmith, bringing together two of Britain\u2019s most fabulously wealthy dynasties. He was worth \u00a3300\u2009million; his bride a comparatively paltry \u00a318\u2009million.\n\nNow, her marriage destroyed, she spends her life trying to control a wannabe rapper. As Jay\u2019s manager, Kate, 31, has had to fit in with him \u2014 swapping designer dresses and jolly lunches for tracksuits and snatched cigarettes outside recording studios.\n\nMeanwhile, Jay, who has a daughter by a previous relationship and a penchant for marijuana and Jack Daniels, has introduced her to life a world away from her comfortable upbringing.\n\nWhen they go out partying, which is often, Jay likes to make an impression. His reputation is as a man who doesn\u2019t care who he offends \u2014 a trait that many blame for his failure thus far to turn talent into record sales.\n\nA smitten Kate, however, feels he can do no wrong. Witness the events of last week, when Jay, 37, (real name Timothy Elpadaro Thedford) demonstrated that while you can take the rapper out of the deprived housing projects of New Orleans, a questionable legacy remains.\n\nKate's marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after Ben uncovered her year-long affair with Jay after reading texts between the two\n\n\u2018He got into a massive argument with the bouncers because they wouldn\u2019t let him into the club,\u2019 says a witness to the fracas, which ended with the couple being admitted. Then, when they left, Jay was clearly the worse for wear because he started trying to open car doors, saying he was going to drive them home. Kate had to drag him away.\n\n\u2018Then he got into another argument \u2014 I think it was something to do with the ridiculous shorts and knee-high socks he was wearing \u2014 and Kate just leaned against a car, looking fed up.\n\n\u2018Eventually, they headed off home, but not with any dignity.\u2019\n\nBen Goldnsmith was so angry when he uncovered Kate's affair that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a child's toy at her\n\nDignity, sadly, has been in short supply\n since Kate\u2019s marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after Ben \nuncovered her year-long affair with Jay after reading texts between the \ntwo. He was so angry that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a\n child\u2019s toy at her.\n\nCue the police being summoned and a hugely unedifying public spat on Twitter, which culminated in divorce. Since then, Kate\u2019s life has changed almost beyond recognition. Always interested in the performing arts, she had been dabbling in the music industry and had set up her own business, Roundtable Records, for whom Jay was a star client, before the marriage broke down.\n\nShe has now swapped life within the London society bubble for a more chaotic existence with Jay. A number of society invitations have been discreetly withdrawn, not least because many of her and Ben\u2019s mutual friends were unimpressed by the public manner of their split.\n\n\u2018Kate leads a dual life,\u2019 adds the family friend. \u2018She is a fantastic mother, utterly dedicated to her three children, but when not on mummy duty she and Jay have a very different lifestyle.\n\n\u2018When I met him I found him perfectly charming. In a curious way, he\u2019s not at all dissimilar to Russell Brand because he is very passionate and articulate in an unconventional manner.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a peacock, but a very masculine peacock. Whereas Ben is socially confident and comfortable dealing with huge financial deals, he wouldn\u2019t be able to change a tyre. Jay could strip down the entire engine and put it back together. I think Kate finds that exciting. There is a passion in this relationship which was sadly lacking with Ben, for all that they were best friends.\u2019\n\nLike Brand \u2014 currently in a relationship with Kate\u2019s erstwhile sister-in-law, Jemima Khan \u2014 Jay is not your typical \u2018bit of rough\u2019.\n\nHis home, secured with the assistance of his ever-attentive manager, Kate, is a fifth-floor apartment in Belgravia. The few who have been invited in speak of a minimalist space with record decks, ashtrays (he and Kate are unreconstructed smokers) and bookshelves lined with weighty tomes including Sartre\u2019s Being And Nothingness and The Communist Manifesto.\n\nKate shares Jay's social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world\n\nJay nips around London on a motor scooter and spends the evenings at gigs with his girlfriend. Kate, who lives with her three children in a \u00a320\u2009million mansion in nearby Kensington, likes nothing more than to drop round to Jay\u2019s at the end of the day and cook dinner.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not like they\u2019re jetting around the world and he\u2019s hanging on her coat tails,\u2019 adds the friend. \u2018They\u2019re living quite a basic existence and he\u2019s very old-fashioned \u2014 when they go out, he pays his way.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s his combination of incredible talent and unassuming manner which appeals to Kate. She\u2019s a thoroughly nice girl who just wants to be normal. She loves urban music, and she\u2019d far rather go to Nando\u2019s than sit in a VIP suite sipping Bollinger and chatting to chinless wonders.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re both square pegs in round holes. Perhaps that\u2019s what has kept them together through everything.\u2019\n\nCertainly, they have weathered more storms than anyone expected. Last year, rumours abounded of an impending split when Jay was said to be spending time chatting up Cara Delevingne and her fellow models. But harmony returned. Today, Kate is happily divorced, combining motherhood with her new life. Family time is, in the words of a well-heeled contemporary, \u2018a life of Batman costumes, cupcakes and play-dates\u2019.\n\nThose who have observed her at close quarters say she is following her heart. Kate is understood to believe that were it not for her illustrious surname, she would have followed a different path. She shares Jay\u2019s social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world.\n\nIn America, many influential figures still have high hopes for him. Beyonce\u2019s husband Jay Z, the billionaire overlord of rap, has signed him up. Yet for all his undoubted talent, he has yet to produce the goods.\n\nHis debut album has been so long awaited it has become an industry joke. Occasionally, he gets drunk and takes to Twitter railing against his critics.\n\nHis reputation as a womaniser is enhanced by the fact he has a daughter with Erykah Badu, the Grammy award-winning singer. Sadly, he has never seen much of the little girl, who lives in America.Kate\u2019s faith in Jay seems unshakeable, but her music business is still to take off. According to her company accounts, Roundtable Records had stocks of \u00a31,885 and cash of \u00a3761, but owes Kate \u00a3365,606.\n\nLooking on the bright side, her relationship with her ex-husband has improved markedly as they share custody and strive to do their best for the children.\n\nWhile Ben, 33, remains hurt by her behaviour, he, too, has moved on and lives near to the family home with his new partner, Jemima Jones, 26, a lingerie model now working as a film producer.

But there is also an iceberg contingent who will be restless if we win, because we have promised too much \u2013 and let Gordon Brown lead the way.\u2019 He explained: \u2018A few MPs are very visibly complaining, but an awful lot more are grumbling out of sight.\u2019\n\nMr Miliband is facing internal ructions over Mr Brown\u2019s promise of enhanced devolution powers, with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls complaining during a tumultuous Shadow Cabinet meeting that he was \u2018out of the loop\u2019 on the offer \u2013 and warned it could prevent a future Labour Government from ever passing a Westminster Budget if Scottish MPs were barred from voting.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday poll highlights how much is at stake for the Labour leader. Survation found that across the UK, Labour\u2019s support is running at 35 per cent \u2013 a lead of four per cent over the Conservatives \u2013 enough to give Mr Milband a Commons majority of 44 if a General Election was held tomorrow.\n\nIf Scotland was excluded, Labour would be one point ahead, on 34 per cent, and Mr Miliband\u2019s majority would be slashed to just nine seats.\n\nDuring his interview, Mr Cameron insisted that the devo max plan in the aftermath of a No vote would be the final \u2018resting place\u2019 of devolution, and it would put an end to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe PM said: \u2018The UK is not indifferent, you hear lots of concerns about what it means for them, what it means for our standing, what the consequences would be.

Mr Balls said: \u2018If we give away the whole tax-raising power to the Scottish Parliament, how can Scottish Labour MPs then vote for a Labour Budget in England?\u2019\n\nCurrently, 40 of the 59 Scottish MPs are Labour, with pollsters predicting Mr Miliband will need a sizeable Scottish contingent at Westminster to form a government with a workable Commons majority after the General Election next May. A witness at the meeting said: \u2018It was clear what Balls was saying.\n\n\u2018He was wondering out loud how we would get Budgets passed at Westminster without Scottish Labour votes. It\u2019d be a nightmare.\u2019\n\nMr Miliband had no answer to his Shadow Chancellor\u2019s concerns, according to reports.\n\nLast night, senior Labour figures said there was mounting anger over Mr Miliband\u2019s \u2018failure\u2019 to energise the vital Scottish Labour vote to come out against independence.\n\nOne said: \u2018If Miliband\u2019s been unable to deliver Labour voters in Scotland \u2013 and the figures point to that \u2013 it\u2019s another nail in the coffin for the party as a whole.\n\n\u2018There would be a major debate about the leadership of our party.\u2019"}, {"annotators_ids": [5, 6, 10, 14, 15, 4, 12, 19, 21, 23], "scores": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "Thomas Moran, 51, brought up five children by three different mothers in Ireland and England while evading authorities.\nHe was arrested in Northampton in 1993 for possession of drugs and on suspicion of intent to supply - but fled court and returned to his native Ireland as a ' fugitive '\nDespite being wanted by police, he split his time between England and Ireland enjoying sightseeing trips, quad biking holidays and fishing with his children.\nGrandfather - of - seven was only caught when he moved back to within a mile of Northampton's police station - where he had been officially registered and was claiming benefits.", "text": "Jet setter: Thomas Moran, pictured, spent 18 years on the run and raised families in two separate countries before he was finally caught - after moving just a mile from a police station\n\nA father who spent 18 years on the run has revealed how he raised families in two separate countries before he was finally caught - after moving just a mile from a police station.\n\nThomas Moran, 51, brought up five children by three different mothers in Ireland and England while evading authorities - despite jetting between the two countries an incredible sixty times.\n\nHe was arrested in Northampton in 1993 for possession of drugs and on suspicion of intent to supply - but fled court and returned to his native Ireland during his 18 years as a \u2018fugitive\u2019.\n\nDespite officially being wanted by police, he split his time between England and Ireland enjoying sightseeing trips, quad biking holidays and fishing with his children.\n\nThe grandfather-of-seven was only caught when he moved back to within a mile of Northampton\u2019s police station and officers arrested him at home - where he had been officially registered and was claiming benefits.\n\nThe builder - who has now pleaded guilty to the offence - told today of his relief at finally being free of the crime which has hung over his head for 18 years.\n\nHe said: 'I had moved to England in 1987 because I needed to get the work.\n\n'But when I was here I fell into a bad crowd and got into drugs and alcohol.\n\n'After my arrest I was moved to a couple of different bail houses but the drugs were still everywhere so I thought I just have to get out of this place.\n\n'So I went back to Ireland to look after my children and raise more kids.

The increases in death risk might therefore be due to underlying health conditions rather than the supplements themselves, says Susan Fisher, Ph.D., a professor of community and preventive medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in Rochester, N.Y.\n\n\"People [often] go to the vitamin store because they feel something isn't right -- their memory is slipping, they don't have as much energy,\" says Fisher, who was not involved in the new study. \"These could be subconscious symptoms of a disease that is eventually going to take their life.\"\n\nHealth.com: Heart trouble? 30 herbal remedies to avoid\n\nThe use of dietary supplements has exploded in the United States in recent decades. According to the study, roughly half of all adults reported taking supplements in 2000.\n\nThe rates were even higher among the 38,772 women in Iowa who participated in the study. Sixty-three percent were taking at least one supplement when the study began, in 1986, but by 2004 that number had jumped to 85%. And more than one-quarter of those women reported taking four or more supplements on a regular basis.\n\nThe women were 62 years old at the beginning of the study, on average, and none had chronic health conditions (with the exception of diabetes and high blood pressure). Just over 40% of the women had died by the time the study ended in 2008.\n\nWomen who took calcium -- which is known to reduce the risk of bone fractures associated with aging -- were 9% less likely to die during the study than women who did not take it, but most of the other supplements were associated with an increased risk of death. Some supplements, including beta-carotene, vitamins A and C, and selenium, didn't appear to affect death risk either way.\n\nHealth.com: 11 foods for healthy bones\n\nHowever, the increases in death risk (or decrease, in the case of calcium) were extremely small and may not be clinically meaningful, says Mary L. Chavez, a professor of pharmacy practice at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Kingsville.\n\nSeveral factors besides supplement use may have shaped the results. Fisher points out, for instance, that the use of hormone therapy to treat the symptoms of menopause was nearly twice as common among supplement users as among nonusers. Some forms of hormone therapy have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and breast cancer.\n\nThe researchers did take hormone therapy into account in their analysis, along with several other potentially mitigating factors (including age, educational attainment, body mass index, diet, and physical activity). But the wide disparity in hormone use between supplement users and nonusers may indicate that the two groups of women were different in subtle yet important ways, Fisher says.\n\nHealth.com: Can supplements ease menopause symptoms?\n\n\"People choosing to take [hormone] replacement therapy often have underlying different characteristics and lifestyle behaviors, which you can't necessarily balance out with a mathematical model,\" she says.\n\nIt's not clear that the study results apply to the population of older women as a whole.

In fact, it's the latest cautionary tale for businesses that devote their entire menus to variations of a single product.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHarbinger of doom: Crumbs shuttered all its 48 locations a week after the struggling cupcake shop operator was delisted from the Nasdaq\n\nHow Crumbs crumbled: Experts say Crumbs Bakery's bankruptcy was caused by over-expansion at a time when demand for cupcakes leveled off\n\nKrispy Kreme, for instance, expanded rapidly in large part on the cult-like following of its doughnuts. But sales started declining and the company ended up closing some locations.\n\nLast year, restaurant industry researcher Technomic said Krispy Kreme had 249 locations, down from 338 a decade ago. The chain has broadened its menu more recently. Executives at Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary later this week, weren't available for comment.\n\nA similar fate befell Mrs. Fields, which is known for its cookies. The chain has suffered in part because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies, and it was down to 230 stores last year, from 438 a decade ago.\n\nTCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago. Part of the chain's problem is the competition, given the proliferation of frozen yogurt places. A representative for the parent company of Mrs. Fields and TCBY wasn't immediately available.\n\nCompanies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks. For one, trendy products tend to attract competition from big and small players that want to jump on the bandwagon. For instance, Starbucks and Cold Stone Creamery have been trying to capitalize on the cupcake trend with cake pops and ice cream cupcakes, respectively.\n\nWhere it all started: The cupcake craze can be traced back to Sex and the City (pictured), which popularized the frosted mini-cakes sold by Magnolia bakery in the 90s\n\nDiversified: Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies and brownies\n\nBeing beholden to a single item also makes companies more susceptible to customers' whims and changing tastes.\n\nThere's always a new fad: frozen yogurt; chopped salads; freshly squeezed juices, and even gourmet toast. Entrepreneurs may be eager to open stores selling these products, but there's always the danger that fickle customers will move on to the next thing.\n\n'A cupcake shop today can't survive on just cupcakes,' said Darren Tristano, a Technomic analyst.\n\nTo combat the risks, many chains diversify their menus. And several have prospered by moving beyond their flagship products.\n\nDunkin' Donuts, for instance, has been pushing aggressively into specialty drinks and sandwiches, with a focus on boosting sales after its morning rush hour.\n\nAnd Starbucks has introduced a range of new foods and drinks in its cafes, including premium bottled juices and salad boxes. The coffee chain even plans to expand wine and beer offering in evenings to as many as 1,000 locations over the next several years.\n\nMagnolia, another popular New York City cupcake shop, is credited for sparking the cupcake craze after it was featured in Sex and the City.\n\nDownsizing: Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary this week, had 249 locations last year, down from 338 a decade ago\n\nStreamlined: The chain Mrs Fields took a hit  because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies and closed down nearly half of its 438 storefronts\n\nFreeze out: The frozen yogurt business TCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago, because of stiff competition\n\nThe chain, which opened in 1996, has endured while many of the cupcake shops that opened up in its wake \u2014 including Crumbs \u2014 focused on just cupcakes. That's in part because Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies, brownies and banana pudding.\n\nSara Gramling, Magnolia's spokeswoman, said the company is learning about the dangers of focusing too heavily on one product, as well as expanding too quickly.\n\n'We'll be mindful of those lessons,' she said.\n\nStill, some chains manage to persevere by carving out a niche where there aren't many competitors; Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon have expanded locations over the years.\n\nAs for Crumbs, the company noted in a statement late Monday that it was evaluating its 'limited remaining options.' That will include a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Crumbs did not provide comment beyond its statement.\n\nWhile some business analysts were quick to conclude that Crumbs\u2019 collapse heralded the end of the decade-long cupcake trend, others suggested that the bakery chain was a special case.\n\nDecade-long fad: Crumbs first opened its doors in March 2003 in Manhattan. The company went public in 2011 but has been suffering as the cupcake boom has deflated\n\nDavid Sax, author of The Tastemakers: Why We\u2019re Crazy for Cupcakes but Fed Up With Fondue, described Crumbs\u2019 failure as \u2018a classic tale of overexpansion and borrowing too much money,\u2019 adding that it was no indicative of the state of the cupcake industry at large, reported the Washington Post.\n\nIn Sax\u2019s retelling of the story, Crumbs\u2019 fatal flaw was that the chain continued opening more and more stores even as demand for cupcakes levelled off. By 2013, the bakery had 70 locations, which brought in less than $650,000 each.\n\nLast cupcake: Before the Crumbs empire crumbled, employees at Likeable Media in New York City bought this sprinkled cupcake from the now-shuttered shop on 42nd Street for $3.95\n\nFour years earlier, each of Crumbs' 25 locations raked in $1.2million in sales.\n\nSax insisted that the frosted mini-cakes have a bright future.\n\n\u2018This is much more a story about one company\u2019s mismanagement of its product line than it is about the hatred or falling off of one particular American pastry,\u2019 he said. \u2018When the housing market crashed in 2007 or 2008, it wasn\u2019t like people stopped investing in real estate.\n\n\u2018The death of Crumbs doesn\u2019t mean the end of every other cupcake bakery.\u2019\n\nThe news of the chain\u2019s bankruptcy comes less than two weeks after the Nasdaq announced it would stop trading Crumbs, which went public in 2011.\n\nCrumbs had seen a steep decline in profitability since its debut on the market: In its quarterly report from March, the company posted an accumulated deficit of $28.8million.\n\nOutside the Crumbs on 42nd Street, near Times Square, disappointment was palpable Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA pregnancy craving brought Neicy Robinson of the Bronx to another Crumbs location before she walked to the Bryant Park store and realized they had all closed.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.

Facebook also recently released 'local awareness' ads that help local business promote themselves to users (pictured right)\n\nEarlier this week, reports said California-based Yahoo (CEO Marissa Mayer shown making her keynote address in January 2014) is planning to invest \u00a312 million ($20 million) in the three year-old tech startup. If true the investment would value the company at \u00a36 billion ($10 billion)\n\nThe move comes after a similar, albeit much larger, investment in Chinese technology firm Alibaba reaped huge dividends for Yahoo, with its $1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThis latest move, according to the Wall Street Journal, comes as Snapchat starts to seek funding from venture-capital firms, money managers and companies.\n\nEarlier this year Instagram  launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt.\n\nThe app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend.\n\nLike Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video.\n\nHowever, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you\u2019re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends.\n\nThe favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total.\n\nBolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world.\n\nSnapchat may be a key partner to Yahoo as it gets set to release Snapchat Discovery next year.\n\nThis is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app, which will likely become a key source of revenue for Snapchat.\n\nSnapchat Discovery would provide a platform for Yahoo to distribute its own content.\n\nHowever, the \u00a36 billion ($10 billion) valuation of a company that hasn't, yet, monetised its users, has been dubbed a risky proposition.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it hasn\u2019t worked before; Microsoft\u2019s 2007 investment in Facebook valued the then three-year old company at \u00a39.4 billion ($15 billion), and later proved hugely successful.\n\nLast year Snapchat infamously turned down a \u00a31.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook - a decision that left many stunned.\n\nBut the move seems to have paid off, as Snapchat\u2019s owners Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company.\n\nIf the valuation holds true, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of \u00a36 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB.\n\nYahoo's move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byer in August this year. Pictured are owners\u00a0Evan Spiegel, left, and Bobby Murphy\n\nSnapchat lets users send photo-messages that vanish within seconds, but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services.\n\nThis may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users.\n\nAlthough Snapchat, and other similar mobile messaging apps, don't have established business models yet, its rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so.\n\nSnapchat is continuing to grow in popularity, with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day.\n\nIn June, Facebook launched a similar app called Slingshot in the hope of replicating Snapchat\u2019s success.\n\nThe app lets consumers exchange photos and videos, which later disappear, without requiring Facebook accounts.\n\nBut despite its rapid growth, Snapchat has had a number of obstacles to contend with.\n\nThe group this year settled charges with US regulators, which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission at the time, photos sent on Snapchat could, in fact, be saved by recipients using several methods, such as taking a screenshot."}, {"annotators_ids": [4, 10, 12, 19, 23, 5, 6, 14, 15, 21], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], "summary": "Paul Bradley, 60, has been charged with aggravated burglary, theft of property, robbery and kidnapping.\nBetty Davis, 73, told a teller she had a bomb strapped to her ankle.\n\" I had coffee with him all last week, \" her husband says.", "text": "(CNN) -- A friend of an elderly Arkansas couple has been charged with forcing the wife to try to rob a bank with a fake explosive device, police said Thursday.\n\nAuthorities in Fayetteville arrested 60-year-old Paul Bradley on Thursday, three days after 73-year-old Betty Davis walked into a bank there and told a teller she had a bomb fastened to her ankle.\n\nHer husband, Dean Davis, said he has known Bradley for some time.\n\n\"I had coffee with him all last week,\" said Davis, whom police said had been tied up in the couple's home while his wife was forced to go to the bank by a masked assailant. \"One morning he paid for my coffee, and I'd like to see him and pay him that back.\"\n\nBradley has been charged with aggravated burglary, theft of property, aggravated robbery and kidnapping, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder told reporters.

Details on plans for the body weren't immediately available.\n\nEarlier Friday, Bankhead had said Zinkhan's body -- found Saturday in a self-dug shallow grave -- could be headed to a pauper's grave if the family didn't claim the body from the Athens-Clarke County coroner's office by Saturday morning.\n\nSuch a grave is typically reserved for unidentified bodies, unclaimed bodies or people without family members.\n\nBankhead said the situation was rare and that it was unclear why the family had taken that long to claim the body of the professor, described by colleagues and acquaintances as aloof and eccentric.\n\nNeighbor Bob Covington remembers a lot of \"forced moments\" with Zinkhan.\n\nThe last such interaction came the afternoon of April 24, the day before witnesses said Zinkhan, 57, killed his wife and two others outside a community theater in Athens.\n\nCovington was walking down the driveway of his Bogart home to check the mail. Zinkhan had just done the same and was walking back to his house. Covington said hello and told Zinkhan that his son, a UGA student who used to mow the Zinkhans' lawn, had recently seen Zinkhan on campus.\n\n\"He said, 'Yeah, that's where I hang out,' and turned and walked into the house,\" said Covington, who lived next door to Zinkhan for eight years.\"That's mostly what it was with George, forced moments.\"\n\nIt was odd for Zinkhan to say more than five or 10 words before disengaging, while his wife, Marie Bruce, was the \"polar opposite,\" Covington said, describing the 47-year-old thespian as engaging and vivacious.\n\nDespite the contrasts in personalities, Covington never saw evidence that there were problems between the two, he said.\n\n\"He never raised his voice at his kids. I never heard that. I never heard him raise his voice at Marie,\" he said.\n\nNeighbors, students and fellow faculty members all concur that Zinkhan was standoffish, but their accounts also paint a contradictory image of the marketing professor who would occasionally walk the halls of UGA's business college barefoot.\n\nSome faculty members were quick to defend Zinkhan, but reluctant to do so on record. One said he felt it was a university matter. Another was reluctant to be on record defending an accused mass killer.\n\n\"He's being painted as an ogre, which doesn't fit,\" said the former.\n\nTwo faculty members said Zinkhan was introverted but friendly. He was close to some colleagues. He remembered their birthdays and was generous with gifts at Christmas.\n\nHis quirky behavior was generally overlooked because of his brilliance, a colleague said. One fellow professor went so far as to call him a genius, and not just with marketing, either.\n\nZinkhan apparently was well-versed in a wide range of topics -- art, opera, architecture -- and he loved sports. Faculty members recalled that the strapping 6-foot-2 Zinkhan played on the intramural softball team with some of his graduate students, and he liked to boast of his home runs.\n\nHe also loved his son, 8, and daughter, 10, and regularly brought them to work.\n\nNeighbors said they saw him outside playing soccer with the kids on a miniature goal that still sat in the yard this week. A basketball goal with a rim a foot or two below regulation stood over the Zinkhans' driveway, and a miniature yellow house sat dormant in his wooded backyard.\n\nA neighbor who asked not to be named said the cedar front door on the house Tuesday was new. A SWAT team had burst through the old front door shortly after Zinkhan allegedly shot Bruce; attorney Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63.\n\nBruce was the president of the board of the Town and Gown Players, a theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater's deck when the shooting took place. Tanner and Teague were identified as set designers for the theater.\n\nCovington saw Zinkhan shortly after the April 25 slayings. He was grilling bratwursts for lunch when Zinkhan rang the doorbell.\n\n\"He asked if I'd mind watching the kids because there'd been an emergency,\" Covington said.\n\nCovington agreed. He thought it was strange when Zinkhan immediately sprinted out of the garage, but didn't pay it much attention because Zinkhan said he had an emergency.\n\nThe children, Covington said, seemed oblivious that their mother had just been slain. It was less than an hour later, when Covington's wife noticed two police officers with shotguns behind the hedges in a nearby yard, that Covington learned his neighbor was accused of a triple killing.\n\nThe police told Covington they were looking for Zinkhan in connection with the shootings.\n\n\"I was incredulous,\" he said.\n\nCovington's daughter, who had baby-sat for the Zinkhans, drew a floor plan of the Zinkhan home for police and told them where the spare key was hidden.\n\nCovington allowed police to use his home in their stakeout and summoned Zinkhan's daughter to see whether she knew anything about what had happened.\n\nIt was clear the girl hadn't seen the slayings, but one of her remarks was chilling, Covington said. Asked what her father's emergency involved, she replied, \"Something about a firecracker.\"\n\nThough many expressed astonishment that Zinkhan was linked to the slayings, some UGA faculty members said they suspected Zinkhan was having problems at home before police confirmed it this week. He lost an estimated 50 pounds in the two months before the shootings, they said.\n\nTo others, the signs of problems were more obvious.\n\nProfessor Barbara Carroll, who had once worked under Zinkhan, wrote an e-mail to her colleagues at the business school saying she went into protective custody after police found a map to her house in Zinkhan's vehicle.\n\nIn the e-mail, she said she had told previous department heads, deans and provosts \"that George Zinkhan was dangerous.\"\n\n\"Many people in this college and this department have known about Zinkhan's 'troubled past' and did nothing about it. Those people also bear responsibility here,\" she wrote.\n\nCarroll did not return phone messages or open her door for reporters Tuesday.\n\nHowever, one of Zinkhan's former students said he and his classmates also thought Zinkhan was more than just odd. David Sackin, 43, was a graduate student and took classes with Zinkhan in 1996 and 1997.\n\nZinkhan's lectures were delivered in monotone, his teaching style was dry and he didn't seem to care what was happening in the classroom, Sackin said.\n\nWhen students convened outside the classroom, they surmised that something darker than a lack of enthusiasm drove Zinkhan's behavior, he said.\n\n\"If anyone asked any of my classmates if there was one professor who'd go on a rampage, who would it be?

'That's my biggest dream and it always has been. He came across as a very kind man, a very good man, and I trusted him.'\n\nThe pair, who had planned to co-parent the children, decided to use in-vitro fertilization with anonymous donor eggs for the pregnancy.

He has temporary custody\n\nWhen she found out earlier this year that, after two rounds of IVF, she was pregnant with twins, 'I was absolutely thrilled,' Close said. 'I always wanted twins.'\n\nBut feelings of joy were quickly replaced with betrayal when she gave birth to a boy and a girl in July - and McMurrey told her he was taking the children.\n\n'The social worker came to me and said we \nhad a surrogate situation,' she said. '[The worker] claimed I was a surrogate for him and his\ndomestic partner that I didn't even know he had.'\n\nHe became so enraged when he saw Close breastfeeding the children in hospital, he took out a restraining order against her, she said.\n\nBetrayal: After the birth, Marvin McMurrey (left) told Close he was gay and the babies would be brought up by him and his partner, Phong Nguyen (right). The children are currently staying with Nguyen\n\nBattle: Close said that even though she used donor eggs to get pregnant there was never a surrogate contract\n\nCindy Close's case is complicated as a doctor advised her to use donor eggs due to her age, so she is not the children's biological mother.\n\nMarvin McMarrey claims she was a surrogate, but typically, a contract must be agreed and the mother and father are spelled out if this is the case.\n\nHowever, attorneys said Texas law does not exclude other arrangements for surrogates, which is an issue the courts may take up here.\n\nIn normal surrogate cases, the intended mother's eggs are used inside a different woman. Even though the intended mother does not carry the children, she is legally the 'mother' due to an agreement. In this case, an anonymous donor was used and the child would have no legal mother, as is required.\n\nAn issue that could also work \nagainst McMurrey, who wants to bring up the children with his gay partner, is that the intended parents have to be married for a\nsurrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state.\n\nTraditional surrogacy - where parents use a surrogate woman's eggs and body to carry a child - is not recognised in Texas.\n\nMcMurrey filed a lawsuit against \nClose in August, demanding he be named as the father as she was simply a\nsurrogate and had no rights.\n\nHe has temporary custody of the children, and they are now living with McMurrey's partner, Phong Nguyen - even though the father does not live there.\n\nClose said she is only allowed to see \nher children for two hours a day on Monday to Friday, and claims the \ncouple has placed cameras in the room to watch her as she holds her \nbabies.\n\n'I only ever wanted to be a mom and... after giving me my dream, he's taking that away,' she said, breaking down in tears.\n\nThe courts will now determine what rights Close has as she struggles to define in legal terms what it means to be a mother.\n\n'We've alleged he duped Cindy into have \nher children on the basis on him attempting to have her declared a \nsurrogate once they were born,' her attorney, Grady Reiff, said.\n\nHe\nexplained that, in Texas, the mother does not need to prove she is the \nparent but McMurrey must prove Close was a surrogate. They never signed a\ncontract or agreement, he said.\n\n'This was not a surrogacy, so it never \noccurred to me that I would ever need a written agreement,' Close told the Houston Chronicle. 'If anything, I thought he would lose \ninterest because I didn't expect him to be a very involved father.'\n\nReiff\nadded: 'It's our position that a woman who gives\nbirth is the mother, unless there is a [surrogate] agreement.' If \nMcMurrey had his way, the children would have no legal 'mother'.\n\nTaking a stand: Attorney Grady Reiff said Cindy was duped and McMurrey must prove she was a surrogate\n\nIn surrogate cases, the intended \nmother's eggs are used and, while she does not carry the child, she is \nthe 'mother' because of the agreement.\n\nIn Texas, it's not the mother's burden to prove she is the parent, Reiff, said, so the onus is now on McMurrey to prove Close was a surrogate.\n\nAnother issue that could work \nagainst McMurrey is that the intended parents have to be married for a\nsurrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state.\n\n'The father is arguing a very technical \nlegal position,' Jim Paulsen, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said. 'But it's one of those cases that you \nhope the judge will be able to look at more than just preliminary \ntechnical matters.'\n\nMcMurrey's attorney, Ellen Yarrell, did not comment on the case.

Kate had to drag him away.\n\n\u2018Then he got into another argument \u2014 I think it was something to do with the ridiculous shorts and knee-high socks he was wearing \u2014 and Kate just leaned against a car, looking fed up.\n\n\u2018Eventually, they headed off home, but not with any dignity.\u2019\n\nBen Goldnsmith was so angry when he uncovered Kate's affair that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a child's toy at her\n\nDignity, sadly, has been in short supply\n since Kate\u2019s marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after Ben \nuncovered her year-long affair with Jay after reading texts between the \ntwo. He was so angry that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a\n child\u2019s toy at her.\n\nCue the police being summoned and a hugely unedifying public spat on Twitter, which culminated in divorce. Since then, Kate\u2019s life has changed almost beyond recognition. Always interested in the performing arts, she had been dabbling in the music industry and had set up her own business, Roundtable Records, for whom Jay was a star client, before the marriage broke down.\n\nShe has now swapped life within the London society bubble for a more chaotic existence with Jay. A number of society invitations have been discreetly withdrawn, not least because many of her and Ben\u2019s mutual friends were unimpressed by the public manner of their split.\n\n\u2018Kate leads a dual life,\u2019 adds the family friend. \u2018She is a fantastic mother, utterly dedicated to her three children, but when not on mummy duty she and Jay have a very different lifestyle.\n\n\u2018When I met him I found him perfectly charming. In a curious way, he\u2019s not at all dissimilar to Russell Brand because he is very passionate and articulate in an unconventional manner.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a peacock, but a very masculine peacock. Whereas Ben is socially confident and comfortable dealing with huge financial deals, he wouldn\u2019t be able to change a tyre. Jay could strip down the entire engine and put it back together. I think Kate finds that exciting. There is a passion in this relationship which was sadly lacking with Ben, for all that they were best friends.\u2019\n\nLike Brand \u2014 currently in a relationship with Kate\u2019s erstwhile sister-in-law, Jemima Khan \u2014 Jay is not your typical \u2018bit of rough\u2019.\n\nHis home, secured with the assistance of his ever-attentive manager, Kate, is a fifth-floor apartment in Belgravia. The few who have been invited in speak of a minimalist space with record decks, ashtrays (he and Kate are unreconstructed smokers) and bookshelves lined with weighty tomes including Sartre\u2019s Being And Nothingness and The Communist Manifesto.\n\nKate shares Jay's social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world\n\nJay nips around London on a motor scooter and spends the evenings at gigs with his girlfriend. Kate, who lives with her three children in a \u00a320\u2009million mansion in nearby Kensington, likes nothing more than to drop round to Jay\u2019s at the end of the day and cook dinner.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not like they\u2019re jetting around the world and he\u2019s hanging on her coat tails,\u2019 adds the friend. \u2018They\u2019re living quite a basic existence and he\u2019s very old-fashioned \u2014 when they go out, he pays his way.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s his combination of incredible talent and unassuming manner which appeals to Kate. She\u2019s a thoroughly nice girl who just wants to be normal. She loves urban music, and she\u2019d far rather go to Nando\u2019s than sit in a VIP suite sipping Bollinger and chatting to chinless wonders.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re both square pegs in round holes. Perhaps that\u2019s what has kept them together through everything.\u2019\n\nCertainly, they have weathered more storms than anyone expected. Last year, rumours abounded of an impending split when Jay was said to be spending time chatting up Cara Delevingne and her fellow models. But harmony returned. Today, Kate is happily divorced, combining motherhood with her new life. Family time is, in the words of a well-heeled contemporary, \u2018a life of Batman costumes, cupcakes and play-dates\u2019.\n\nThose who have observed her at close quarters say she is following her heart. Kate is understood to believe that were it not for her illustrious surname, she would have followed a different path. She shares Jay\u2019s social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world.\n\nIn America, many influential figures still have high hopes for him. Beyonce\u2019s husband Jay Z, the billionaire overlord of rap, has signed him up. Yet for all his undoubted talent, he has yet to produce the goods.\n\nHis debut album has been so long awaited it has become an industry joke. Occasionally, he gets drunk and takes to Twitter railing against his critics.\n\nHis reputation as a womaniser is enhanced by the fact he has a daughter with Erykah Badu, the Grammy award-winning singer. Sadly, he has never seen much of the little girl, who lives in America.Kate\u2019s faith in Jay seems unshakeable, but her music business is still to take off. According to her company accounts, Roundtable Records had stocks of \u00a31,885 and cash of \u00a3761, but owes Kate \u00a3365,606.\n\nLooking on the bright side, her relationship with her ex-husband has improved markedly as they share custody and strive to do their best for the children.\n\nWhile Ben, 33, remains hurt by her behaviour, he, too, has moved on and lives near to the family home with his new partner, Jemima Jones, 26, a lingerie model now working as a film producer. It is a conventional life, but he is happy.\n\nWhether the same can be said of Kate is questionable."}, {"annotators_ids": [10, 4, 6, 15, 5, 12, 19, 21, 14, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Pablo Zabaleta reckons Sergio Aguero can become Manchester City's first Ballon d ' Or winner.\nArgentina striker hit 19 goals in 20 games this season before suffering a knee ligament injury in December.", "text": "Pablo Zabaleta reckons Sergio Aguero can become Manchester City's first Ballon d'Or winner - but only if he can stay injury free.\n\nThe Argentina striker hit 19 goals in 20 games this season before suffering a knee ligament injury in December - the latest in a long line of setbacks.\n\nAnd his international and club team-mate thinks that if he can repeat the form but not the setbacks he could be crowned the best footballer on the planet.\n\nSergio Aguero (left) reels away in celebration as a dejected Danny Rose looks on at The Etihad Stadium\n\nManchester City ace Aguero was in fine former before injuring his knee in the December clash with Everton\n\n'Sergio is one of the best strikers in the world, for sure \u2013 he is in the top five,' Zabaleta told the Manchester Evening News as part of City in the Community's new Walking Football programme.\u2019\n\n'As a City player I would love to see one of our players get nominated for the Ballon d'Or, and we have a very strong squad with top players.\n\nFormer Manchester City star Mike Summerbee (left) takes on Pablo Zabaleta at a game of walking football\n\nCheeky David Silva (left) flashes his skills against participants taking part in walking football initiative\n\n'We know that (four-times winner) Lionel Messi and (back-to-back winner) Cristiano Ronaldo are probably the best two in the world, and Real Madrid and Barcelona are very lucky to have them.\n\n'But we also have very good players and if Aguero can keep 100 per cent fit for the whole season, he will have a chance to be there one day.'\n\nAguero was on the bench for City's 1-1 draw with Everton last weekend and is expected to start in Sunday's Premier League clash with Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nZabaleta (right) believes a fit again \u00a0Aguero is good enough to be crowned a Ballon d'Or winner\n\nZabaleta is also looking forward to the challenge of facing the Gunners' Alexis Sanchez, a player his own manager Manuel Pellegrini described as 'player of the moment'.\n\n'He has had a very big impact on the Premier League, and has probably been Arsenal's main player,' he added.\n\n'He is fast, his technical ability is fantastic and he scores and assists goals \u2013 the complete player.'\n\nArsenal recruit Alexis Sanchez has caused a storm since arriving in the Premier League from Barcelona\n\nArgentinean striker Aguero takes a tumble after a challenge from Muhamed Besic and Seamus Coleman"}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 5, 19, 10, 12, 14, 21, 4, 15, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "David Millward, 55, secretly filmed carrying bags of animal feed.\nHe pocketed \ufffd100,000 of benefits claiming he could not walk 30ft.\nMillward pleaded guilty to two offences of cheating today.\nHe admitted claiming income support and illegally collecting disability living allowance.", "text": "A farmer who claimed he could not walk 30ft and illegally pocketed \ufffd100,000 in benefits was caught on camera herding cattle and climbing fences.\n\nDavid Millward, 55, was secretly filmed by the Department of Work and Pensions carrying bags of animal feed around the field he rented in Coven, Staffordshire.\n\nFootage showed him climbing over a fence, filling feeding trays and loading cattle into his trailer all without walking aids and displaying only a slight limp.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nCaught on camera: David Millward was secretly filmed carrying bags of animal feed after he pocketed \ufffd100,000 of benefits, claiming he could not walk 30ft\n\nMillward illegally pocketed \ufffd75,532 in income support and \ufffd24,692 in disability living allowance by the time the scam was uncovered last year following a probe launched after a tip off in 2010.

Details on plans for the body weren't immediately available.\n\nEarlier Friday, Bankhead had said Zinkhan's body -- found Saturday in a self-dug shallow grave -- could be headed to a pauper's grave if the family didn't claim the body from the Athens-Clarke County coroner's office by Saturday morning.\n\nSuch a grave is typically reserved for unidentified bodies, unclaimed bodies or people without family members.\n\nBankhead said the situation was rare and that it was unclear why the family had taken that long to claim the body of the professor, described by colleagues and acquaintances as aloof and eccentric.\n\nNeighbor Bob Covington remembers a lot of \"forced moments\" with Zinkhan.\n\nThe last such interaction came the afternoon of April 24, the day before witnesses said Zinkhan, 57, killed his wife and two others outside a community theater in Athens.\n\nCovington was walking down the driveway of his Bogart home to check the mail. Zinkhan had just done the same and was walking back to his house. Covington said hello and told Zinkhan that his son, a UGA student who used to mow the Zinkhans' lawn, had recently seen Zinkhan on campus.\n\n\"He said, 'Yeah, that's where I hang out,' and turned and walked into the house,\" said Covington, who lived next door to Zinkhan for eight years.\"That's mostly what it was with George, forced moments.\"\n\nIt was odd for Zinkhan to say more than five or 10 words before disengaging, while his wife, Marie Bruce, was the \"polar opposite,\" Covington said, describing the 47-year-old thespian as engaging and vivacious.\n\nDespite the contrasts in personalities, Covington never saw evidence that there were problems between the two, he said.\n\n\"He never raised his voice at his kids. I never heard that. I never heard him raise his voice at Marie,\" he said.\n\nNeighbors, students and fellow faculty members all concur that Zinkhan was standoffish, but their accounts also paint a contradictory image of the marketing professor who would occasionally walk the halls of UGA's business college barefoot.\n\nSome faculty members were quick to defend Zinkhan, but reluctant to do so on record. One said he felt it was a university matter. Another was reluctant to be on record defending an accused mass killer.\n\n\"He's being painted as an ogre, which doesn't fit,\" said the former.\n\nTwo faculty members said Zinkhan was introverted but friendly. He was close to some colleagues. He remembered their birthdays and was generous with gifts at Christmas.\n\nHis quirky behavior was generally overlooked because of his brilliance, a colleague said. One fellow professor went so far as to call him a genius, and not just with marketing, either.\n\nZinkhan apparently was well-versed in a wide range of topics -- art, opera, architecture -- and he loved sports. Faculty members recalled that the strapping 6-foot-2 Zinkhan played on the intramural softball team with some of his graduate students, and he liked to boast of his home runs.\n\nHe also loved his son, 8, and daughter, 10, and regularly brought them to work.\n\nNeighbors said they saw him outside playing soccer with the kids on a miniature goal that still sat in the yard this week. A basketball goal with a rim a foot or two below regulation stood over the Zinkhans' driveway, and a miniature yellow house sat dormant in his wooded backyard.\n\nA neighbor who asked not to be named said the cedar front door on the house Tuesday was new. A SWAT team had burst through the old front door shortly after Zinkhan allegedly shot Bruce; attorney Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63.\n\nBruce was the president of the board of the Town and Gown Players, a theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater's deck when the shooting took place. Tanner and Teague were identified as set designers for the theater.\n\nCovington saw Zinkhan shortly after the April 25 slayings. He was grilling bratwursts for lunch when Zinkhan rang the doorbell.\n\n\"He asked if I'd mind watching the kids because there'd been an emergency,\" Covington said.\n\nCovington agreed. He thought it was strange when Zinkhan immediately sprinted out of the garage, but didn't pay it much attention because Zinkhan said he had an emergency.\n\nThe children, Covington said, seemed oblivious that their mother had just been slain. It was less than an hour later, when Covington's wife noticed two police officers with shotguns behind the hedges in a nearby yard, that Covington learned his neighbor was accused of a triple killing.\n\nThe police told Covington they were looking for Zinkhan in connection with the shootings.\n\n\"I was incredulous,\" he said.\n\nCovington's daughter, who had baby-sat for the Zinkhans, drew a floor plan of the Zinkhan home for police and told them where the spare key was hidden.\n\nCovington allowed police to use his home in their stakeout and summoned Zinkhan's daughter to see whether she knew anything about what had happened.\n\nIt was clear the girl hadn't seen the slayings, but one of her remarks was chilling, Covington said. Asked what her father's emergency involved, she replied, \"Something about a firecracker.\"\n\nThough many expressed astonishment that Zinkhan was linked to the slayings, some UGA faculty members said they suspected Zinkhan was having problems at home before police confirmed it this week. He lost an estimated 50 pounds in the two months before the shootings, they said.\n\nTo others, the signs of problems were more obvious.\n\nProfessor Barbara Carroll, who had once worked under Zinkhan, wrote an e-mail to her colleagues at the business school saying she went into protective custody after police found a map to her house in Zinkhan's vehicle.\n\nIn the e-mail, she said she had told previous department heads, deans and provosts \"that George Zinkhan was dangerous.\"\n\n\"Many people in this college and this department have known about Zinkhan's 'troubled past' and did nothing about it. Those people also bear responsibility here,\" she wrote.\n\nCarroll did not return phone messages or open her door for reporters Tuesday.\n\nHowever, one of Zinkhan's former students said he and his classmates also thought Zinkhan was more than just odd. David Sackin, 43, was a graduate student and took classes with Zinkhan in 1996 and 1997.\n\nZinkhan's lectures were delivered in monotone, his teaching style was dry and he didn't seem to care what was happening in the classroom, Sackin said.\n\nWhen students convened outside the classroom, they surmised that something darker than a lack of enthusiasm drove Zinkhan's behavior, he said.\n\n\"If anyone asked any of my classmates if there was one professor who'd go on a rampage, who would it be? They'd unanimously say Zinkhan,\" Sackin said.\"He was strange, definitely.\"\n\nIn her e-mail, Carroll told colleagues they may never know the whole story. Indeed, police have said only that one of the victims, Tanner, \"appeared to be a specific target in the shootings and was shot first.\"\n\nThe prospect of learning specifics about what could have propelled a painfully private introvert to homicide probably died in a shallow grave behind a Bogart elementary school.\n\nCNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report."}, {"annotators_ids": [19, 6, 14, 5, 10, 12, 15, 21, 4, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Almost the entirety of the country's West has experienced significantly warmer than average temperatures across December and January.\nThis month there have been 4, 074 records set for warm temperatures across the West.\nThis includes hot weather records in Seattle, San Jose, Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City.\nRemarkably, the average February temperature in Salt Lake city is 16. 4degrees above average, while Boise is up 12.\nIn contrast to the big dry in the West, the West is experiencing one of its warmest winters on record.\nDrought conditions have worsened in West and Midwest.", "text": "While blizzards, snow and freezing conditions batter parts of the East Coast, unseasonably warm temperatures across the rest of the country mean the U.S. is experiencing one of its warmest winters on record.\n\nAlmost the entirety of the country's West has experienced significantly warmer than average temperatures across December and January, while parts of the East Coast, including New York and Boston  are continuing to be battered by a freezing storm system.\n\nIn this month alone thousands of warm weather records have been broken as high temperatures across the western states contributes to what is now the country's sixth-warmest winter on record.\n\nThe West is experiencing temperatures which have contributed to the country's sixth-warmest winter on record.

I collected it up and used it to build the barn.\n\n'I just did it bit by bit. I started small - laying all the stones up and pouring concrete down the back to secure it and it just continued to grow.\n\n'I think I just got a bit carried away really.\n\n'Rather than a modest barn, I started building turrets and dovecots - which were inhabited by lots of birds, including one owl that lived there the whole time I owned the land.\n\nArchitecture: The build features several arches, left, plus tens of hand made windows and turrets, right, all constructed by the artist - who farmed sheep on the land\n\n'Organic': Mr Stokes said he did not draw any plans for the sprawling barn, which he based on a selection of buildings he had liked throughout his life\n\nEnchanting: Through one of the entrances to the barn, left, is a spiral staircase which leads to the top of one of the dovecotes.

I took \ninspiration from buildings that I had seen during my life that \nlooked like they were part of their surroundings. I like buildings to \nlook like they belong.'\n\nThe \nbarn is split into several different rooms with varying levels. One \nsection - called 'The Hermitage' by Mr Stokes - has several stained \nglass windows, all hand-made by Mr Stokes.\n\n'The windows represent spring, summer, autumn and winter as well as earth, air, fire and water, and are just another nod to the natural world,' Mr Stokes said.\n\nHowever, having spent over a decade on his magical building, Mr Stokes - who said he doesn't know how the build first became known as the Hobbit House - sold up when a quarry opened nearby.\n\nMr Stokes said: 'I don't like it when people call it the Hobbit House. I never made it to look like that. I just call it my barn. There are also apparently rumours that I had a dispute with the planning office - which is utter nonsense. I moved on because of a quarry.\n\n'They found Forest Marble - which is in high demand - near to my land. I knew there would be lots of lorries trundling in and out constantly so I decided to give it all up.\n\n'When I first sold up, I had dreams about it every night. A woman spends nine months carrying a child, but I spent 11 years on the barn. I felt lost without it.\n\n'Although it was a really difficult decision, know I made the right choice. I've moved on and have done other things.\n\nMr Stokes added that he had only been back to the building once since he left in 2000.\n\nInterior: The barn includes a place for Mr Stokes to sleep during lambing season, pictured left, and several examples of the artist's stained glass windows, right\n\nArtistic: This picture shows another window made by Mr Stokes. With its flowers and muted tones, it is suppose to represent the spring months of the year\n\nUnique: Mr Stokes, who calls this yellow-walled section of the build 'The Hermitage', also made several art pieces for the barn, pictured\n\nThe 'Hobbit House' has now become a frequent stop for photographers and explorers looking to capture some of the building's magic.Manchester photographer Dan Circa, 28, took this set of images after he decided to track down the quirky construction.He said: 'Normally buildings like this are built for novelty, but once upon a time this was actually someone\u2019s home.''It felt like I was in a movie like Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, and I half expected a tiny person to ask me what I was doing in there.

Appeals court challengers said in a court filing.\n\n'Major economic decisions like these - indeed, any decisions granting tax credits - must be made unambiguously by Congress itself.'\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety.\n\n'It is pretty obvious what the congressional intent was here,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, which was for every qualified American to receive a subsidy 'regardless of whether it was state officials or federal officials running the marketplace.'\n\nPierce said the D.C. ruling is 'at odds with the goal of the law.'\n\n'We believe that this decision is incorrect, inconsistent with \nCongressional intent,' the Justice Department official said.\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers to the law are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety\n\nAn appeals court filing by congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act, similarly argues that 'Congress did not provide that the tax credits would only be available to citizens whose states set up their own exchanges.'\n\nCongressional lawmakers and state legislators who are against the law hope that by limiting the subsidies to state exchanges, they can destabilize important aspects of the law, such as the individual mandate requiring most people to buy insurance.\n\nAndre \nDavis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge serving on the Richmond court, explained the court's decision this way:\n\n'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would\n be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham \nand pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from \nDomino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a \nliteral construction of my lunch order.'\n\nDavis and his colleagues voted to uphold what the Obama administration says was the 'intent' of law - subsidies for all qualified Americans, regardless of whether they signed up for coverage through the state or federal exchanges.\n\n'Today\u2019s ruling highlights the ramifications of hastily passing legislation before fully knowing and understanding what it entails and how it will affect people,' House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers said in a statement after the D.C. decision was handed down.\n\n'For months, people all across this country have seen firsthand the flawed and ineffective implementation of Obamacare \u2013 in their skyrocketing premiums, lost coverage, limited access, and regulatory inefficiencies.\n\n'And today\u2019s decision is only further evidence of the legislation\u2019s failure,' the GOP leader said.' It\u2019s time to listen to the American people, enact real health care reforms, and start over. This law does not work.'\n\nAndre \nDavis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge who wrote a concurring opinion on the Richmond court's decision, said he was not going to allow anti-Obamacare advocates to use the court to deny 'millions of Americans desperately-needed health insurance.'\n\nDavis admitted that the federal law was 'tortured' and it's construction was 'nonsensical' but it's 'manifest purpose, as revealed by the wholeness and coherence of its text and structure, could not be more clear.'\n\nIn an attempt to explain the law in lay terms, Davis offered up an equally tortured pizza-based analogy.\n\n'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would\n be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham \nand pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from \nDomino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a \nliteral construction of my lunch order,' he said.\n\nJudges on the D.C. case were Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush; A. Raymond Randolph, an appointee of Bush's father; and Harry Edwards, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, who dissented.\n\nA lower court had ruled that the law's text, structure, purpose, and legislative history make 'clear that Congress intended to make premium tax credits available on both state-run and federally-facilitated Exchanges.'\n\nBut the appeals court concluded the opposite - that the letter of the law 'unambiguously restricts' the law's subsidies to policies sold through exchanges established by the state.\n\n'An Exchange established by the federal government cannot possibly be \"an Exchange established by the State,\" ' Randolph wrote in a concurring opinion. 'To hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation.\n\n'Only further legislation could accomplish the expansion the government seeks.'\n\nIn a statement celebrating the D.C. court's decision, Sam Kazman, general counsel for the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, one of the organization's responsible for \nfunding the lawsuit said, 'The court\u2019s decision puts an end to the power grab that the IRS rule represented.\n\n'And more importantly it reaffirms the fact that we are a nation of laws enacted by Congress rather than rules issued by agenda-driven agencies,' Kazman added.\n\n'Despite all the political calls for the country to 'get with the program and support Obamacare,\" it\u2019s the Framers of the Constitution who have the last word.'"}, {"annotators_ids": [19, 4, 6, 21, 5, 10, 12, 14, 15, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "U.S. border agents discovered marijuana hidden inside a spool of industrial wire.\nSome 100 have been discovered underground since 1990.\nThe most sophisticated tunnels have lights, air systems and hydraulics.\nBorder agents have found radios, cells phones and global positioning system tracking devices.\nThe same thinking applies to drugs smuggled in the waters of the eastern Pacific off the coasts of Central and South America, Reyes said.\nThe submersibles are built in the rebel-controlled jungles of Colombia, and the U.S. Coast Guard said cartels pay for construction.", "text": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Drug traffickers are throwing everything they've got at getting drugs into the United States any way they can.\n\nU.S. border agents discovered marijuana hidden inside a spool of industrial wire.\n\nAt the San Ysidro crossing near the Mexican border, officials have found drugs smuggled in things such as tables, toys, furniture, holiday candles, even tennis shoes.\n\n\"Their bottom line is to make money, and they are going to do whatever they can to ensure that that happens,\" said Mike Unzueta, the special agent in charge for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego. \"They've become very, very creative.\"\n\nDrugs also are brought in underground through tunnels; some 100 have been discovered since 1990 along the 1,950-mile U.S.-Mexico border. The most sophisticated tunnels have lights, air systems and hydraulics. While drugs flow north into the United States, weapons and cash flow south into Mexico.\n\nThe smuggling organizations are well-established and sophisticated. They have a recognized hierarchy and employ the latest technology, said Rafael Reyes, chief of global enforcement operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  Watch the creative techniques drug smugglers are using \u00bb\n\nBorder agents have found radios, cells phones and global positioning system tracking devices, leading officials to believe drug cartels positioned on or close to the border are in constant contact with drug runners.\n\n\"These guys are very ingenious,\" Reyes said. \"They will exploit any vulnerability that they can.\"\n\nReyes said that means factoring in the possibility a certain percentage of drugs will be seized by federal agents: \"They'll line up 10 loads, and if you pick off two or three, well, that's the cost of doing business, 'I got seven across.' So it's that shotgun mentality.\"\n\nThe same thinking applies to drugs smuggled in the waters of the eastern Pacific off the coasts of Central and South America.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Capt. Vincent DeLaurentis and his crew on the cutter Hamilton came back from three months of searching for drugs inbound to Mexico. They covered an area of ocean about the size of the Southeastern United States. They captured six hard-to-detect boats that travel at night and seized 30,000 pounds of pure cocaine.\n\nDeLaurentis said drug traffickers have become much more aggressive in their smuggling tactics. Among the new trends, he said, \"They're using vessels that are less and less detectable, whether it's these go-fast boats that travel at night or the new self-propelled semi-submersible vessels.\"    Click here for photos of the ways in which drugs are moved into the U.S. \u00bb\n\nKnown as SPSS, self-propelled semi-submersibles are something like submarines, but they cannot fully submerge. Anywhere from several inches to a couple of feet remain above the water line; they are painted a blue or gray for camouflage, and they are flat on top with valves and air holes.\n\nThey are difficult to detect and have become increasingly sophisticated. Some can travel up to 5,000 miles and use fuel tanks for ballast. They can carry some seven to 10 tons of drugs, and because of their low profiles and low radar signatures, the vessels are popular, DeLaurentis said.\n\nThe submersibles are built in the rebel-controlled jungles of Colombia, and the U.S. Coast Guard said cartels pay for construction. The craft rendezvous with fishing vessels or \"go-fasts\" -- boats that are typically 40 feet long, go 40 knots and can carry several tons of heroin or cocaine. The drugs then go to Mexico, where the cargo is offloaded and transported across the border into the U.S.\n\n\"The fact they're developing semi-subs that can carry huge amounts of drugs and running those vessels for thousands of miles tells me that it's a very sophisticated operation,\" said Capt. Tom Farris, commander of Coast Guard Sector San Diego.\n\nThe Coast Guard tries to engage and board these vessels before they get to Mexico. But evidence of drug smuggling needed for prosecution is hard to come by --- because traffickers on these crafts easily can escape by opening a hatch, tossing out a life raft and then scuttling the vessel to the bottom of the ocean along with its cargo.\n\nA U.S. law signed in January makes it illegal to operate a stateless SPSS and will allow the Coast Guard to arrest people it used to have to release because drug evidence was on the bottom of the ocean.\n\nMexico produces three out of the four major abused drugs in the United States -- marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines, according to the DEA. Cocaine, however, comes from South America, but it and the other three drugs are all shipped through Mexico into the United States.\n\n\"Mexico has become a vital hub,\" Reyes said.\n\nAccording to the DEA, 90 percent of all cocaine destined for the U.S. comes through the Mexican-Central American corridor, with 47 percent not stopping in Central America but going to Mexico.\n\nThe primary transit routes from Mexico into the U.S. are: Tijuana to San Diego, Sonora to Phoenix, Arizona; Chihuahua to El Paso, Texas; and the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which will cover the remaining south of the border, to the Texas cities of Laredo and Brownsville.\n\n\"Those are the principal lucrative corridors,\" Reyes said. They are \"controlled by separate organizations because of the market they have in the United States, and it is a profit-minded approach they take in securing these corridors for themselves.\"\n\nThe San Ysidro port of entry is the busiest border crossing with Mexico and the United States. More than 110,000 people pass through every day, making it fertile ground for drug cartels looking for new ways to ship drugs.\n\nPort Director Oscar Preciado oversees the San Ysidro crossing. On any given day, he said agents seize five to 10 loads -- about 50 to 500 pounds of marijuana, cocaine, heroin or methamphetamines.

Thirty seconds and two more kisses later we were all on our way.

He co-starred in NBC's \"I Spy,\" becoming the first African-American male to star in a prime-time network drama -- and won three Emmys doing it.\n\nIn 1984, two decades later, Cosby made another pioneering TV achievement, reviving the then-dormant sitcom form by starring as the patriarch of a loving family called the Huxtables. The Cosby Show soon was TV's No. 1 show, and helped make NBC television's No. 1 network -- all while blasting another programming myth: That white viewers wouldn't embrace an all-black TV show.\n\nNow, 30 years after doctor and dad Cliff Huxtable, and almost 50 years after tennis trainer and secret agent Alexander Scott, NBC is returning to the Bill Cosby well one more time -- and hoping his stardom, fan base and legacy can bring some much-needed magic to broadcast television in the 21st century.\n\nThe Deadline Hollywood website has reported that NBC and Cosby, partnered with producer Tom Werner (part owner of the company that produced \"The Cosby Show\"), have reached an agreement to produce a family sitcom starring Cosby.\n\nThe question is, can lightning strike thrice? Can Cosby make TV history yet again? And is it even fair to expect or ask him to?\n\nRemember, first of all, that not every Bill Cosby TV series has been a guaranteed hit. After \"I Spy,\" Cosby scored big in the children's television arena, with the animated \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" and his playful appearances on \"The Electric Company\" and \"Sesame Street.\" But his prime-time series didn't always score as successes.\n\nHis first NBC series after \"I Spy,\" the 1969 sitcom \"The Bill Cosby Show,\" showcased him as a high-school coach and phys ed teacher. It was a very smart series, and positioned Cosby's Chet Kincaid in a strong position of authority, but it didn't catch on.\n\nHis next series -- for CBS this time -- came in 1972: a weekly variety series called \"The New Bill Cosby Show.\" Its key ingredients, in addition to Cosby's weekly comic monologues, included dancer-actress Lola Falana, pretend drunk Foster Brooks, and bandleader Quincy Jones. But this show, in an era when variety shows were as ubiquitous as reality shows are today, was gone after one season.\n\n1976's \"Cos,\" for ABC, was a variety show aimed at youngsters. It lasted two months. Then came \"The Cosby Show,\" eight seasons of which singlehandedly moved TV from the topical and raw comedy of Norman Lear's sitcoms to an era in which television parents regained control, and family civility returned.\n\nAfter \"The Cosby Show\" were more Cosby series, ones that never captured the same zeitgeist: NBC's \"The Cosby Mysteries\" (1994-95), and CBS's \"Cosby\" sitcom (1996-2000, re-teaming him with \"Cosby Show\" TV spouse Phylicia Rashad), and an \"Art Linkletter's House Party\" sequel of sorts: CBS's \"Kids Say the Darndest Things\" (1998-2000), with Cosby interviewing children.\n\nIn other words, over his TV career, Bill Cosby has hit as many singles and doubles as home runs. At 76, does Cosby have another long-ball miracle in him?\n\nMy bet is that he can, indeed, do it again -- provided he swings for the fences, and that NBC does nothing to impede Cosby from following his instincts and doing precisely what he wants.\n\nThe major warning flag, on NBC right now, is \"The Michael J. Fox Show,\" which has returned another '80s NBC sitcom icon to television -- but not successfully, because the network seemed to think that merely signing Fox and bringing him back was enough. It isn't. You need the right role, the right writers and the right cast, and you have to put them all together at the right time.\n\nBut Cosby, like a comedy locust, seems amazingly designed to surface every two or three decades and capture the imagination. In the right vehicle, he can do it again.\n\nHis timing and his jokes were on full, hilarious display in last year's Comedy Central standup special, whose title may prove prophetic: \"Bill Cosby: Far from Finished.\" Can his humor still work today, when, as always, he avoids going \"blue\"? It certainly worked on Comedy Central. Blue, black -- Bill Cosby never has made color more of a priority than universality.\n\nIf I were given a vote in designing Cosby's 21st-century sitcom comeback vehicle, I'd craft it as a dual home life/workplace vehicle, like the classic \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\" At home, let Cosby be the family grandpa, holding court over a loving, lively, extended family.\n\nBut let him to go work beyond retirement age, too, as a tenured college professor or a veteran media pundit on a TV talk show. Either way, he'd get to vent about current events, forgotten history and anything else the real William H. Cosby Ph.D. would care to bring to the viewing public via prime-time TV.\n\nIncluding, of course, his observations on family and other parts of his still-funny monologues. More than 50 years after he released his first comedy album, Bill Cosby is a very funny fellow.

Picture posed by model\n\nUK spy agencies want to install 'black box' surveillance devices across the country's communications networks to monitor internet use, it emerged today.\n\nA report by an influential committee of MPs tells how spooks are keen to implement a nationwide surveillance regime aimed at logging nearly everything Britons do and say online.\n\nThe spy network will rely on a technology known as Deep Packet Inspection to log data from communications ranging from online services like Facebook and Twitter, Skype calls with family members and visits to pornographic websites.\n\nBut civil liberties and privacy campaigners have reacted with outrage, saying that the technology will give the government a greater surveillance capability than has ever been seen.\n\nThe report by Parliament's \nIntelligence and Security Committee, published on Tuesday, gives UK \nintelligence agencies' perspective on the government's draft \nCommunications Data Bill, which is intended to update surveillance \npowers.\n\nThe government \nargues that swift access to communications data is critical to the fight\n against terrorism and other high-level crime, but it has been delayed \nafter the Liberal Democrats dropped support for the bill.\n\nMI5\n chief Jonathan Evans told the committee: 'Access to communications data\n of one sort or another is very important indeed. It\u2019s part of the \nbackbone of the way in which we would approach investigations.\n\n'I\n think I would be accurate in saying there are no significant \ninvestigations that we undertake across the service that don\u2019t use \ncommunications data because of its ability to tell you the who and the \nwhen and the where of your target\u2019s activities.'\n\nThe Bill has encountered stiff \nopposition, but authorities have been at pains to stress that they're \nnot seeking unfettered access to the content of emails or recordings of \nphone calls.\n\nInstead, they \nclaim, what they are after is what many have described as 'outside of \nthe envelope' information: Who sends a message, where and how it is \nsent, and who receives it.\n\nFor\n example, while the email addresses of senders and recipients would be \navailable to agencies, they would still need to obtain a court order for\n access to the contents of the emails.\n\nA\n similar situation would apply in the case of mobile phone calls, with \nthe callers' identities and locations available to agencies, along with \nthe time of the call and its duration, but agents restricted from listening without authorisation from the courts.\n\nThe Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ)\n on the west of Cheltenham: Spooks say swift access to communications data is critical to the fight\n against terrorism and other high-level crimes\n\nCritics have said that in effect \nthere is no way to reliably separate such communications data from the \ncontent of messages and calls, and that giving easy access to the former\n would also open the way to access of the latter.\n\nCampaigners also challenged the \ngovernment over how it could criticise totalitarian regimes overseas which\n may be using similar systems to crack down on dissent.\n\nSpymaster: MI5 Director General Jonathan Evans said access to communications data is 'very important indeed' to UK security\n\nEmma Carr, deputy director of privacy\n and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'Using \nhighly intrusive technology to monitor how people use the internet is \nnot something that a civil society should be using on every citizen.\n\n'The danger is that the whole \ncommunication, including content, is inspected and potentially stored, \nintruding on people\u2019s privacy in a dangerous and unprecedented way.\n\n'This sends a highly dangerous signal\n to regimes around the world who are looking for justification to use \nsimilar equipment on their populations.\n\n'The fact that at no point does the \nGovernment need court approval, either to install, use or look at data \ngathered is a major concern and if it is to be used as a last resort \nshould only be done so on the highest judicial authority.'\n\nJim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns for freedom online, said the real threat was posed by the addition of what the report calls the 'filter' to the surveillance system.\n\nHe explained that this would work as a kind of search engine for everyone's private data, linking it together from the various online and telecoms accounts people use to communicate.\n\n'The really worrying part of this is the \"filter\" the government wants to build,' he told MailOnline.\n\n'This would put data from your mobile phone, email, web history and phones together, so the police can tell who your friends are, what your opinions are, where you've been and with who.\n\n'It could make instant surveillance of everything you do possible at the click of a button.'\n\nA key challenge for the government \nhas been extracting that information from overseas service providers - \ncompanies based in Silicon Valley or elsewhere that might not feel \nobliged to comply with a British spy agency's request.\n\nWhile the government has insisted that it will not invade the privacy of citizens' communications without a court order, there are fears that installing deep packet inspection across the UK will nevertheless give them the capability.\n\nLuckily, there is a range of software for both computers and mobile devices, much of it free, that can encrypt communications to keep it secure.\n\n1) iSafeguard Freeware 6.2: This program will secure emails and files using strong encryption and syncs with most popular email clients.\n\n2) HushMail: This web-based email service uses a Java applet to encode emails with 1024bit public key encryption.\n\n3) GnuPG: This Linux-only application is an open-source replacement for PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). PGP was one of the first military-grade encryption products available to the general public.\n\nIt was in those cases, the committee's report\u00a0 said, that the surveillance devices would come in handy.\n\n'It\n is important for the agencies that there is some means of accessing \ncommunications data from uncooperative overseas communications service \nproviders,' the report said.\n\nThe report said the probes would \nwork using 'deep packet inspection,' so-called because it allows those \nintercepting packets of data to comb through their content.\n\nThe\n services that might be targeted by the probes weren't identified, \nalthough Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Google Chat are all popular in \nBritain and were among the services named elsewhere in the report.\n\nBritain's surveillance plans remain in draft form, and the report carried several critiques of the government's proposals.\n\nBut in general it rejected opponents' claims that the surveillance regime was unworkable or oppressive, warning that the pace of technological change would soon 'have a serious impact on the intelligence and security agencies' unless the new surveillance powers were introduced.\n\nThe report also appeared to reject suggestions that encryption might allow those trying to maintain the privacy of their communications to baffle government monitoring.\n\n'We have heard that the government has (redacted) options in dealing with the challenge encryption poses,' the report said.\n\nThe next two paragraphs were completely blanked out.\n\nMr Killock of the Open Rights Group said it was unlikely that the government had the capability to crack advanced digital encryption."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 19, 10, 15, 4, 5, 12, 14, 21, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Lukas Podolski has made 121 appearances for Germany.\nJoachim Loew warned him he must play at Arsenal.\nThe former Cologne and Bayern Munich man has found his first-team opportunities restricted this season.", "text": "Former Germany manager Rudi Voller has backed Lukas Podolski to rediscover his best form once he has sorted out his club future.\n\nPodolski was a World Cup winner in the summer but has struggled to get a game at Arsenal, and Germany coach Joachim Loew has admitted the situation is jeopardising his place in the national team.\n\nThe former Cologne and Bayern Munich forward is to thrash out his future with the Gunners this winter with a move away from London looking increasingly likely.\n\nLukas Podolski has made 121 appearances for Germany, scoring 47 goals in the process\n\nVoller does not believe Podolski has played his last game for Germany, though, and expects to see him revitalised in the new year.\n\n'You must not write Poldi off,' he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

'The issue with gender and women featured more prominently in Australia's role in the war that it did in other countries.'\n\n60,000 Australian lives were lost in battle, which meant one in ten men who was sent overseas never returned home. Hundreds of thousands more came back as casualties of war, with serious physical and debilitating mental scars.\n\n'The [initial] rush to enlist was in light of they thought it would be a war that would be over so quickly.' Professor Macintyre said. Little did they know the battle would continue for years.\n\nIn Australia because women had the vote they played a key role in deciding conscription laws, pictured here at a recruiting march\n\nThe female population was divided on conscription, and some in favour took part in processions\n\nWives, mothers and sisters had a heavy burden taking on the roles of the men and living with the fear, and often horrific reality, of losing loved ones\n\nWomen are seen here packing chests full of donated items to send overseas\n\nThe local press would report on the proceedings of the war, but their information was often delayed by days.

While it was common for women to assume different roles in absence of the men, Australian women had less opportunity to actively participate in the war.\n\nProfessor Macintyre revealed: 'There were many patriotic women who wanted to play a part but found it difficult to do so.' Unlike in WWII where women had the chance to carry rifles, during WWI mothers and wives fell into 'comfort' roles.\n\nThey worked for charities in volunteer roles - collecting funds for soldier's relief, and knitted socks and balaclavas to send to the troops. ANZAC biscuits and tobacco were also gifted to those fighting.\n\nAs they didn't have the opportunity to actively participate in the war, women found other ways to throw their support behind the troops\n\nWives and mothers assumed what were known as comfort roles during WWI while looking after the household and children\n\nMore than 60,000 Australian men lost their lives during battle, pictured here are soldiers in Liverpool, NSW before they departed\n\nWomen enjoyed a greater sense of autonomy within society while scores of men were on the battlefields\n\nIn the home the women stepped up into traditionally male roles, and had a greater sense of autonomy within society.\n\n'In many households women took the dual role of mother and head of the household in the absence of men', Professor Macintyre said. However when, or if, the men returned, there was a strong push towards restoring traditional gender roles.\n\nProfessor Macintyre, who is one of Australia's most influential public intellectuals, whose most widely known work is the History of Wars, which focuses on various aspects of war history in Australia but also worldwide.\n\nHowever they were expected to move back in to traditional gender roles once, or if, the men returned\n\nOne in ten soldiers, seen here cleaning their rifles in the trenches, never made it home\n\nThe Red Cross was one of the charities which many women volunteered for\n\nPost-war, despite the expectation for women to assume their gendered roles, some war widows would not have that opportunity and would be raising their children as single parents.\n\nSmall towns were left with gaping holes in their populations when men didn\u2019t return and people often lost many men from the one family.\n\nThere were also the husbands and sons who returned from battle so damaged that they simply couldn't cope with the demons from war and were unable to care for themselves, let alone their offspring.\n\nMany men who returned suffered deep physical and mental scars from the war\n\nReunions were held at the end of the war, like this one in Georgetown, South Australia"}, {"annotators_ids": [19, 5, 14, 15, 21, 6, 10, 12, 23, 4], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Kiana Workman, 38, from Brooklyn, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom in Union, New Jersey, on Tuesday.\nPolice said he put lotion on his mother, leaving behind handprints, in an attempt to make her feel better.\nThe boy, now in state custody, was taken to a hospital where he was treated for malnourishment and dehydration, police said.\nHe was not strong enough to open the refrigerator and was unable to open a can of soup.\nWorkman's mother is recuperating from a double hip replacement at a nursing center.", "text": "A naked, malnourished four-year-old boy found inside an apartment in New Jersey with the body of his dead mother had resorted to eating from a bag of sugar, police said Wednesday.\n\nThe toddler\u2019s first request after being examined, police said, was a grilled cheese sandwich and a juice.\n\nHis mother, identified as Kiana Workman, 38, from Brooklyn, was discovered dead Tuesday on the floor of her bedroom after maintenance workers at the apartment complex in northern New Jersey reported a foul odor.\n\nHeartbreaking outcome: The decomposing body of 38-year-old Kiana Workman is being wheeled out of an apartment in Union, New Jersey, where she had remained for four days with her young son\n\nBecause the chain lock was on, police said, her son couldn't get out.\n\nOfficer Joseph Sauer said the boy was\nnaked but coherent and not crying when he kicked in the door and his \npartner lifted the youngster up by the arms and pulled him out of the \noverheated apartment.\n\n\u2018The only way to describe the little \nboy was it was like a scene from World War II, from a concentration \ncamp, he was that skinny.

In fact, it's the latest cautionary tale for businesses that devote their entire menus to variations of a single product.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHarbinger of doom: Crumbs shuttered all its 48 locations a week after the struggling cupcake shop operator was delisted from the Nasdaq\n\nHow Crumbs crumbled: Experts say Crumbs Bakery's bankruptcy was caused by over-expansion at a time when demand for cupcakes leveled off\n\nKrispy Kreme, for instance, expanded rapidly in large part on the cult-like following of its doughnuts. But sales started declining and the company ended up closing some locations.\n\nLast year, restaurant industry researcher Technomic said Krispy Kreme had 249 locations, down from 338 a decade ago. The chain has broadened its menu more recently. Executives at Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary later this week, weren't available for comment.\n\nA similar fate befell Mrs. Fields, which is known for its cookies. The chain has suffered in part because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies, and it was down to 230 stores last year, from 438 a decade ago.\n\nTCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago. Part of the chain's problem is the competition, given the proliferation of frozen yogurt places. A representative for the parent company of Mrs. Fields and TCBY wasn't immediately available.\n\nCompanies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks. For one, trendy products tend to attract competition from big and small players that want to jump on the bandwagon. For instance, Starbucks and Cold Stone Creamery have been trying to capitalize on the cupcake trend with cake pops and ice cream cupcakes, respectively.\n\nWhere it all started: The cupcake craze can be traced back to Sex and the City (pictured), which popularized the frosted mini-cakes sold by Magnolia bakery in the 90s\n\nDiversified: Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies and brownies\n\nBeing beholden to a single item also makes companies more susceptible to customers' whims and changing tastes.\n\nThere's always a new fad: frozen yogurt; chopped salads; freshly squeezed juices, and even gourmet toast. Entrepreneurs may be eager to open stores selling these products, but there's always the danger that fickle customers will move on to the next thing.\n\n'A cupcake shop today can't survive on just cupcakes,' said Darren Tristano, a Technomic analyst.\n\nTo combat the risks, many chains diversify their menus. And several have prospered by moving beyond their flagship products.\n\nDunkin' Donuts, for instance, has been pushing aggressively into specialty drinks and sandwiches, with a focus on boosting sales after its morning rush hour.\n\nAnd Starbucks has introduced a range of new foods and drinks in its cafes, including premium bottled juices and salad boxes. The coffee chain even plans to expand wine and beer offering in evenings to as many as 1,000 locations over the next several years.\n\nMagnolia, another popular New York City cupcake shop, is credited for sparking the cupcake craze after it was featured in Sex and the City.\n\nDownsizing: Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary this week, had 249 locations last year, down from 338 a decade ago\n\nStreamlined: The chain Mrs Fields took a hit  because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies and closed down nearly half of its 438 storefronts\n\nFreeze out: The frozen yogurt business TCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago, because of stiff competition\n\nThe chain, which opened in 1996, has endured while many of the cupcake shops that opened up in its wake \u2014 including Crumbs \u2014 focused on just cupcakes. That's in part because Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies, brownies and banana pudding.\n\nSara Gramling, Magnolia's spokeswoman, said the company is learning about the dangers of focusing too heavily on one product, as well as expanding too quickly.\n\n'We'll be mindful of those lessons,' she said.\n\nStill, some chains manage to persevere by carving out a niche where there aren't many competitors; Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon have expanded locations over the years.\n\nAs for Crumbs, the company noted in a statement late Monday that it was evaluating its 'limited remaining options.' That will include a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Crumbs did not provide comment beyond its statement.\n\nWhile some business analysts were quick to conclude that Crumbs\u2019 collapse heralded the end of the decade-long cupcake trend, others suggested that the bakery chain was a special case.\n\nDecade-long fad: Crumbs first opened its doors in March 2003 in Manhattan. The company went public in 2011 but has been suffering as the cupcake boom has deflated\n\nDavid Sax, author of The Tastemakers: Why We\u2019re Crazy for Cupcakes but Fed Up With Fondue, described Crumbs\u2019 failure as \u2018a classic tale of overexpansion and borrowing too much money,\u2019 adding that it was no indicative of the state of the cupcake industry at large, reported the Washington Post.\n\nIn Sax\u2019s retelling of the story, Crumbs\u2019 fatal flaw was that the chain continued opening more and more stores even as demand for cupcakes levelled off. By 2013, the bakery had 70 locations, which brought in less than $650,000 each.\n\nLast cupcake: Before the Crumbs empire crumbled, employees at Likeable Media in New York City bought this sprinkled cupcake from the now-shuttered shop on 42nd Street for $3.95\n\nFour years earlier, each of Crumbs' 25 locations raked in $1.2million in sales.\n\nSax insisted that the frosted mini-cakes have a bright future.\n\n\u2018This is much more a story about one company\u2019s mismanagement of its product line than it is about the hatred or falling off of one particular American pastry,\u2019 he said. \u2018When the housing market crashed in 2007 or 2008, it wasn\u2019t like people stopped investing in real estate.\n\n\u2018The death of Crumbs doesn\u2019t mean the end of every other cupcake bakery.\u2019\n\nThe news of the chain\u2019s bankruptcy comes less than two weeks after the Nasdaq announced it would stop trading Crumbs, which went public in 2011.\n\nCrumbs had seen a steep decline in profitability since its debut on the market: In its quarterly report from March, the company posted an accumulated deficit of $28.8million.\n\nOutside the Crumbs on 42nd Street, near Times Square, disappointment was palpable Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA pregnancy craving brought Neicy Robinson of the Bronx to another Crumbs location before she walked to the Bryant Park store and realized they had all closed.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m so lost,\u2019 she said. \u2018I just want some cupcakes!\u2019\n\nLots of dough: The bidding on the baked rarity started at $250, but those who wish to buy it now can do so for $1,000\n\nBut those craving that one final sugary, moist bite still have a chance to get their hands on the last Crumbs cupcake, USA Today reported.\n\nBefore the Crumbs empire crumbled, employees at Likeable Media in New York City picked up a sprinkled cupcake from the now-shuttered shop on 42nd Street for $3.95.\n\nInstead of wolfing down the dessert, enterprising staffers decided to put it up for sale on eBay with an opening bid of $250.\n\nThose diehard fans of the defunct bakery who do not want to wait until Friday when the bidding ends can snap up the cupcake right now for $1,000."}, {"annotators_ids":

We believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property.\n\n'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough, and I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area between 21:00-23:00hrs to come forward and speak to us if they heard or saw anything suspicious. We are also seeking information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used.\n\n'The fast response to the 999 call ensured that two suspects were apprehended and the victim could receive immediate first aid.\n\n'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.'\n\nHe will have to have further reconstructive surgery to repair a shattered eye socket and forehead.\n\nMr Kohler\u2019s wife Samantha MacArthur described the attackers as \u2018cowardly and wicked\u2019 and praised her husband\u2019s bravery.\n\nThe couple married in April in Jesus College Cambridge where their four daughters were bridesmaids.\n\nMiss MacArthur, 50, said: \u2018This was just totally pointless and totally cruel and cowardly. What sort of men, covering their heads, hold a man down and just beat him for no reason?\u2019\n\n\u2018He is amazingly brave. Three men were beating him up and he didn\u2019t stop. He fought the whole way and I\u2019m sure if he hadn\u2019t it would have been a lot worse for all of us. It was incredibly traumatic and we are very angry and upset. We have no idea what has happened. We have no reason.\u2019\n\nMr Kohler runs the Cellar Door bar in Aldwych, central London, with Gordon Anderson, who told the Daily Telegraph that he had no idea why his colleague was set upon.\n\nHe told the newspaper: 'Paul is a beautiful human being. I can't understand how anyone could do this to him.'\n\nThe 52-year-old explained that the bar was part of the London cabaret and drag seen and that the venture was 'successful and fun'.\n\nAsked whether he believed the assault may have been linked to the bar in some way, he added: 'I have no idea. That is a matter for the police.'\n\nAnyone with information is urged to call the incident room on 020 8649 3159; Or if you with to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}, {"annotators_ids": [19, 6, 13, 15, 4, 5, 12, 14, 21, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Terrified drinkers dived for cover as Nure Bregu, 47, walked into the bar in the Italian village of Fontaniva, near Padua, and smashed up the machines in a fit of rage that is said to have lasted around 30 seconds.\nCalm before the storm: Pub regulars sit unaware that Nure Bregu, 47, seen at the left of the image, is about to take his frustration out on seven fruit machines with an axe 'He just walked in very calmly with an axe and smashed all the machines.\n'He had been in the bar every day for the past fortnight the owner said and had spent several hours at the machines.", "text": "This is the dramatic moment a frustrated gambler returned to an Italian bar and smashed up seven fruit machines with an axe after losing more than \ufffd4,000.\n\nTerrified drinkers dived for cover as Nure Bregu, 47, walked into the bar in the Italian village of Fontaniva, near Padua, and smashed up the machines in a fit of rage that is said to have lasted around 30 seconds.\n\nOnce he had destroyed the machines, Bregu calmly walked out of the Bar Madonnina and gave a thumbs up to two onlookers before waiting for the police to arrive and arrest him.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nArmed: Bregu, right of the picture, is seen calmly walking into the bar carrying an axe\n\nCalm before the storm: Pub regulars sit unaware that Nure Bregu, 47, seen at the left of the image, is about to take his frustration out on seven fruit machines with an axe\n\nAnger: Bregu strikes the first fruit machine with the axe in a fit of rage\n\nAggressive: Bregu takes aim at another machine as drinkers start to realise what is happening behind them\n\nWitnesses said that the father-of-two was a regular on the fruit machines and had spent several hours feeding coins into them and complaining that he had lost 5,000 Euros (\ufffd4,313).\n\nBregu was sentenced to six years in jail for criminal damage, but walked free from court as prison sentences under two years are not enforced due to overcrowding.\n\nThe Chinese owner of the bar, who declined to be named, said: 'He comes in here all the time to play the machines.

The case was settled this year for an undisclosed amount after an Arizona jury awarded the family $5.2 million on its claims.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged the border towns have supported a campaign of intimidation against those outside of the FLDS, denying them housing and municipal services. Attorneys for the towns have denied wrongdoing.\n\nShane Stubbs told the Associated Press some of his family's problems come from an ongoing land dispute. He said part of his wheat and alfalfa farm belongs to a trust fund that used to be run by the FLDS but has been in control of state of Utah for nearly a decade.\n\nThe family leases the land from the court-appointed accountant who oversees $100 million in homes and property in the border communities in the trust, Stubbs said. The truck was sitting on this disputed section with a flat tire that hadn't been repaired, he said.\n\n'They've caused us all kinds of problems,' Stubbs said. 'They plowed up our wheat. They've run the cows and their sheep on their field.'\n\nAttorneys who have represented the FLDS in legal matters have said the church hasn't had a spokesperson in years. The church has no listed headquarters, and members are instructed not to speak with outsiders.\n\nBack in June, Tom Horne, Arizona's Attorney General, said in a press release 'The disbandment of the Colorado City/Hildale Marshal\u2019s Office is necessary and appropriate because this police department has operated for decades, and continues to operate, as the de facto law enforcement arm of the FLDS Church.\u00a0We have introduced legislation for the past three years to transfer law enforcement to the Mohave County sheriff and unfortunately it has failed to pass.'\n\n'Testimony in support of this legislation shows that when girls have tried to escape from the town, the Marshalls forced them back, and committed many other injustices,' he added. 'When the legislation failed, I found $400,000 per year to transfer to the Mohave County sheriff, to have at least one sheriff in Colorado City. As a result, girls have escaped who said they couldn\u2019t have without the sheriff there.\n\n'My office will not tolerate corrupt law enforcement agencies in this State, and the disbandment of what is perhaps the most corrupt police department in the history of this State will go a long way toward protecting the public from further discrimination and harm in these communities,' Horne also said."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 13, 19, 21, 23, 14, 15, 4, 5, 12], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Christine Greenslade, 66 met friends in tearful reunion this week.\nShe placed obituary for her mother in Cornish newspaper in 1980.\nShe accidentally printed Christine's name instead of mother's.\nOnly one missing from original line-up was Mrs Upton.", "text": "Many years may have passed since they last met, but the bonds of friendship among these women have clearly stood the test of time.\n\nBut this is a reunion that, until recently, seemed impossible because three of these former schoolfriends have spent the past 30-plus years thinking one of their old gang was dead.\n\nThey found out they were wrong when Christine Greenslade, now 66, decided to trace the chums she grew up with in Penzance, Cornwall.\n\nTogether again: Christine Greenslade, 66 met her long-lost friends in a tearful reunion this week.

"text": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Drug traffickers are throwing everything they've got at getting drugs into the United States any way they can.\n\nU.S. border agents discovered marijuana hidden inside a spool of industrial wire.\n\nAt the San Ysidro crossing near the Mexican border, officials have found drugs smuggled in things such as tables, toys, furniture, holiday candles, even tennis shoes.\n\n\"Their bottom line is to make money, and they are going to do whatever they can to ensure that that happens,\" said Mike Unzueta, the special agent in charge for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego. \"They've become very, very creative.\"\n\nDrugs also are brought in underground through tunnels; some 100 have been discovered since 1990 along the 1,950-mile U.S.-Mexico border. The most sophisticated tunnels have lights, air systems and hydraulics. While drugs flow north into the United States, weapons and cash flow south into Mexico.\n\nThe smuggling organizations are well-established and sophisticated. They have a recognized hierarchy and employ the latest technology, said Rafael Reyes, chief of global enforcement operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  Watch the creative techniques drug smugglers are using \u00bb\n\nBorder agents have found radios, cells phones and global positioning system tracking devices, leading officials to believe drug cartels positioned on or close to the border are in constant contact with drug runners.\n\n\"These guys are very ingenious,\" Reyes said. \"They will exploit any vulnerability that they can.\"\n\nReyes said that means factoring in the possibility a certain percentage of drugs will be seized by federal agents: \"They'll line up 10 loads, and if you pick off two or three, well, that's the cost of doing business, 'I got seven across.' So it's that shotgun mentality.\"\n\nThe same thinking applies to drugs smuggled in the waters of the eastern Pacific off the coasts of Central and South America.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Capt. Vincent DeLaurentis and his crew on the cutter Hamilton came back from three months of searching for drugs inbound to Mexico. They covered an area of ocean about the size of the Southeastern United States. They captured six hard-to-detect boats that travel at night and seized 30,000 pounds of pure cocaine.\n\nDeLaurentis said drug traffickers have become much more aggressive in their smuggling tactics. Among the new trends, he said, \"They're using vessels that are less and less detectable, whether it's these go-fast boats that travel at night or the new self-propelled semi-submersible vessels.\"    Click here for photos of the ways in which drugs are moved into the U.S. \u00bb\n\nKnown as SPSS, self-propelled semi-submersibles are something like submarines, but they cannot fully submerge. Anywhere from several inches to a couple of feet remain above the water line; they are painted a blue or gray for camouflage, and they are flat on top with valves and air holes.\n\nThey are difficult to detect and have become increasingly sophisticated. Some can travel up to 5,000 miles and use fuel tanks for ballast. They can carry some seven to 10 tons of drugs, and because of their low profiles and low radar signatures, the vessels are popular, DeLaurentis said.\n\nThe submersibles are built in the rebel-controlled jungles of Colombia, and the U.S. Coast Guard said cartels pay for construction. The craft rendezvous with fishing vessels or \"go-fasts\" -- boats that are typically 40 feet long, go 40 knots and can carry several tons of heroin or cocaine. The drugs then go to Mexico, where the cargo is offloaded and transported across the border into the U.S.\n\n\"The fact they're developing semi-subs that can carry huge amounts of drugs and running those vessels for thousands of miles tells me that it's a very sophisticated operation,\" said Capt. Tom Farris, commander of Coast Guard Sector San Diego.\n\nThe Coast Guard tries to engage and board these vessels before they get to Mexico. But evidence of drug smuggling needed for prosecution is hard to come by --- because traffickers on these crafts easily can escape by opening a hatch, tossing out a life raft and then scuttling the vessel to the bottom of the ocean along with its cargo.\n\nA U.S. law signed in January makes it illegal to operate a stateless SPSS and will allow the Coast Guard to arrest people it used to have to release because drug evidence was on the bottom of the ocean.\n\nMexico produces three out of the four major abused drugs in the United States -- marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines, according to the DEA. Cocaine, however, comes from South America, but it and the other three drugs are all shipped through Mexico into the United States.\n\n\"Mexico has become a vital hub,\" Reyes said.\n\nAccording to the DEA, 90 percent of all cocaine destined for the U.S. comes through the Mexican-Central American corridor, with 47 percent not stopping in Central America but going to Mexico.\n\nThe primary transit routes from Mexico into the U.S. are: Tijuana to San Diego, Sonora to Phoenix, Arizona; Chihuahua to El Paso, Texas; and the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which will cover the remaining south of the border, to the Texas cities of Laredo and Brownsville.\n\n\"Those are the principal lucrative corridors,\" Reyes said. They are \"controlled by separate organizations because of the market they have in the United States, and it is a profit-minded approach they take in securing these corridors for themselves.\"\n\nThe San Ysidro port of entry is the busiest border crossing with Mexico and the United States. More than 110,000 people pass through every day, making it fertile ground for drug cartels looking for new ways to ship drugs.\n\nPort Director Oscar Preciado oversees the San Ysidro crossing. On any given day, he said agents seize five to 10 loads -- about 50 to 500 pounds of marijuana, cocaine, heroin or methamphetamines.

Details on plans for the body weren't immediately available.\n\nEarlier Friday, Bankhead had said Zinkhan's body -- found Saturday in a self-dug shallow grave -- could be headed to a pauper's grave if the family didn't claim the body from the Athens-Clarke County coroner's office by Saturday morning.\n\nSuch a grave is typically reserved for unidentified bodies, unclaimed bodies or people without family members.\n\nBankhead said the situation was rare and that it was unclear why the family had taken that long to claim the body of the professor, described by colleagues and acquaintances as aloof and eccentric.\n\nNeighbor Bob Covington remembers a lot of \"forced moments\" with Zinkhan.\n\nThe last such interaction came the afternoon of April 24, the day before witnesses said Zinkhan, 57, killed his wife and two others outside a community theater in Athens.\n\nCovington was walking down the driveway of his Bogart home to check the mail. Zinkhan had just done the same and was walking back to his house. Covington said hello and told Zinkhan that his son, a UGA student who used to mow the Zinkhans' lawn, had recently seen Zinkhan on campus.\n\n\"He said, 'Yeah, that's where I hang out,' and turned and walked into the house,\" said Covington, who lived next door to Zinkhan for eight years.\"That's mostly what it was with George, forced moments.\"\n\nIt was odd for Zinkhan to say more than five or 10 words before disengaging, while his wife, Marie Bruce, was the \"polar opposite,\" Covington said, describing the 47-year-old thespian as engaging and vivacious.\n\nDespite the contrasts in personalities, Covington never saw evidence that there were problems between the two, he said.\n\n\"He never raised his voice at his kids. I never heard that. I never heard him raise his voice at Marie,\" he said.\n\nNeighbors, students and fellow faculty members all concur that Zinkhan was standoffish, but their accounts also paint a contradictory image of the marketing professor who would occasionally walk the halls of UGA's business college barefoot.\n\nSome faculty members were quick to defend Zinkhan, but reluctant to do so on record. One said he felt it was a university matter. Another was reluctant to be on record defending an accused mass killer.\n\n\"He's being painted as an ogre, which doesn't fit,\" said the former.\n\nTwo faculty members said Zinkhan was introverted but friendly. He was close to some colleagues. He remembered their birthdays and was generous with gifts at Christmas.\n\nHis quirky behavior was generally overlooked because of his brilliance, a colleague said. One fellow professor went so far as to call him a genius, and not just with marketing, either.\n\nZinkhan apparently was well-versed in a wide range of topics -- art, opera, architecture -- and he loved sports. Faculty members recalled that the strapping 6-foot-2 Zinkhan played on the intramural softball team with some of his graduate students, and he liked to boast of his home runs.\n\nHe also loved his son, 8, and daughter, 10, and regularly brought them to work.\n\nNeighbors said they saw him outside playing soccer with the kids on a miniature goal that still sat in the yard this week. A basketball goal with a rim a foot or two below regulation stood over the Zinkhans' driveway, and a miniature yellow house sat dormant in his wooded backyard.\n\nA neighbor who asked not to be named said the cedar front door on the house Tuesday was new. A SWAT team had burst through the old front door shortly after Zinkhan allegedly shot Bruce; attorney Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63.\n\nBruce was the president of the board of the Town and Gown Players, a theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater's deck when the shooting took place. Tanner and Teague were identified as set designers for the theater.\n\nCovington saw Zinkhan shortly after the April 25 slayings. He was grilling bratwursts for lunch when Zinkhan rang the doorbell.\n\n\"He asked if I'd mind watching the kids because there'd been an emergency,\" Covington said.\n\nCovington agreed. He thought it was strange when Zinkhan immediately sprinted out of the garage, but didn't pay it much attention because Zinkhan said he had an emergency.\n\nThe children, Covington said, seemed oblivious that their mother had just been slain. It was less than an hour later, when Covington's wife noticed two police officers with shotguns behind the hedges in a nearby yard, that Covington learned his neighbor was accused of a triple killing.\n\nThe police told Covington they were looking for Zinkhan in connection with the shootings.\n\n\"I was incredulous,\" he said.\n\nCovington's daughter, who had baby-sat for the Zinkhans, drew a floor plan of the Zinkhan home for police and told them where the spare key was hidden.\n\nCovington allowed police to use his home in their stakeout and summoned Zinkhan's daughter to see whether she knew anything about what had happened.\n\nIt was clear the girl hadn't seen the slayings, but one of her remarks was chilling, Covington said. Asked what her father's emergency involved, she replied, \"Something about a firecracker.\"\n\nThough many expressed astonishment that Zinkhan was linked to the slayings, some UGA faculty members said they suspected Zinkhan was having problems at home before police confirmed it this week. He lost an estimated 50 pounds in the two months before the shootings, they said.\n\nTo others, the signs of problems were more obvious.\n\nProfessor Barbara Carroll, who had once worked under Zinkhan, wrote an e-mail to her colleagues at the business school saying she went into protective custody after police found a map to her house in Zinkhan's vehicle.\n\nIn the e-mail, she said she had told previous department heads, deans and provosts \"that George Zinkhan was dangerous.\"\n\n\"Many people in this college and this department have known about Zinkhan's 'troubled past' and did nothing about it. Those people also bear responsibility here,\" she wrote.\n\nCarroll did not return phone messages or open her door for reporters Tuesday.\n\nHowever, one of Zinkhan's former students said he and his classmates also thought Zinkhan was more than just odd. David Sackin, 43, was a graduate student and took classes with Zinkhan in 1996 and 1997.\n\nZinkhan's lectures were delivered in monotone, his teaching style was dry and he didn't seem to care what was happening in the classroom, Sackin said.\n\nWhen students convened outside the classroom, they surmised that something darker than a lack of enthusiasm drove Zinkhan's behavior, he said.\n\n\"If anyone asked any of my classmates if there was one professor who'd go on a rampage, who would it be? They'd unanimously say Zinkhan,\" Sackin said.\"He was strange, definitely.\"\n\nIn her e-mail, Carroll told colleagues they may never know the whole story.

It was sunny but cool, she remembers.\n\nLaura Geraghty was shocked 21 times before she came back from cardiac arrest with tales of the afterlife.\n\nThe mother of two, also a grandmother, was at her job, driving a school bus for the Newton Public School District in suburban Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nHer passengers, special-needs children, were wheelchair-bound.\n\nSeemingly in good health and in good spirits, Geraghty was finishing up her late-morning run, transporting a student and teacher back to Newton South High School, when she realized she was in trouble.\n\nAs she was pulling into the school parking lot, she began having sharp stomach pains. She was able to park her bus, but she kept feeling worse.\n\nThe pain \"went right up my arm and into my chest, and I said, 'Uh-oh, I'm having a heart attack,' \" she said.\n\nThe teacher ran from the bus to get help. Newton South's nurse, Gail Kramer, and CPR instructor Michelle Coppola arrived moments later with the school's new automated external defibrillator.\n\nGeraghty, barely conscious, was fading fast. She was weak and having trouble breathing. And then she went into full cardiac arrest.\n\n\"Her eyes were wide, and all of a sudden she stopped talking to us,\" Coppola said. \"I grabbed the two pads, stuck them on her, started it up, and I'd say within 20 seconds, she had her first shock.\"\n\nCoppola and Kramer performed CPR while they waited for paramedics.  See an expert give a quick lesson in CPR \u00bb\n\nAt that point, Geraghty says, her body died. She remembers watching the scene unfold -- as if from above.\n\n\"I floated right out of my body.

I looked back at it once, and it was there.\"\n\nGeraghty says she saw deceased loved ones, her mother and her ex-husband.\n\n\"It was very peaceful and light and beautiful. And I remember like, when you see someone you haven't seen in a while, you want to hug them, and I remember trying to reach out to my ex-husband, and he would not take my hand. And then they floated away.\"\n\nNext, she says, she was overwhelmed by \"massive energy, powerful, very powerful energy.\"\n\n\"When that was happening, there were pictures of my son and my daughter and my granddaughter, and every second, their pictures flashed in my mind, and then I came back.\"\n\nWhat Geraghty had was a near-death experience, fairly common in people who go into sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nGeraghty was down for 57 minutes. No blood pressure, no pulse, no oxygen, no blood flow. She was shocked 21 times before she finally came back with tales of the afterlife.\n\nAccording to the Near Death Experience Research Foundation, nearly 800 near-death experiences happen every day in the United States.\n\nDr. Kevin Nelson, a neurologist in Lexington, Kentucky, studies near-death experiences and says they're not imagined. The explanation, he says, lies in the brain itself.\n\n\"These are real experiences. And they're experiences that happen at a time of medical crisis and danger,\" Nelson said.\n\nHumans have a lot of reflexes that help keep us alive, part of the \"fight or flight\" response that arises when we're confronted with danger.\n\nNelson thinks that near-death experiences are part of the dream mechanism and that the person having the experience is in a REM, or \"rapid eye movement,\" state.\n\n\"Part of our 'fight or flight' reflexes to keep us alive includes the switch into the REM state of consciousness,\" he said.\n\nDuring REM sleep, there is increased brain activity and visual stimulation. Intense dreaming occurs as a result.\n\nAnd the bright light so many people claim to see?\n\n\"The activation of the visual system caused by REM is causing the bright lights,\" Nelson said.\n\nAnd the tunnel people speak of, he says, is lack of blood flow to the eye. \"The eye, the retina of the eye, is one of the most exquisitely sensitive tissues to a loss of blood flow. So when blood flow does not reach the eye, vision fails, and darkness ensues from the periphery to the center. And that is very likely causing the tunnel effect.\"\n\nNelson is doing studies now to prove that the same effect results from fainting.\n\n\"The most common cause of near-death experience in my research group is fainting. Upwards of 100 million Americans have fainted. That means probably tens of millions of Americans have had these unusual experiences.\"\n\nBut Geraghty says this was no dream. \"I know I went someplace else. I know I went someplace else other than here.\"\n\nDr. Bill O'Callahan, the emergency room doctor who shocked her back to life, agrees. \"Cynics out there would say and agnostics would say that's phenomenon that comes from a dying brain. I think that's hogwash. I firmly believe that people experience these events.\" Cheating Death: Back from the dead\n\nBob Schriever, co-founder of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association, was refereeing a high school football game seven years ago when he went into cardiac arrest, died and was revived.\n\nHe, too, questions the dream explanation. \"Why are so many people dreaming the same thing? How can so many people, and there's hundreds of thousands of people who have experienced this, how can we all be dreaming the same thing and describe the exact same thing?\"\n\nSchriever says these experiences are so profound that only someone who has gone through them can truly understand.\n\nSeven years later, he is still consumed with his own near-death experience.\n\n\"I think about that every morning when I wake up, first thing, during the day, I don't know how many times and every night before I fall asleep. I think about that. People do not understand or appreciate what we go through.\" Scientist uses poison gas to suspend life\n\nFor Geraghty, it's a daily struggle to put the pieces back together again.\n\n\"I've been someplace that not everybody can go, and there's not a lot of people you can sit down and have that conversation with,\" Geraghty said. \"My own daughter tells me, 'It's freaky, Mom.' I've literally lost friends over this the minute they hear it.\" Tweet your own experience and you could win a copy of \"Cheating Death\"\n\nGeraghty says she became depressed once she left the hospital because her perspective on her entire life changed. She still gets depressed, she says, and is on medication.\n\n\"I actually went to my doctor and said to her, 'I think I'm losing my mind. This can't be really happening,' you know, and she said it's OK, it's very hard to understand when you've been through an experience like that.\"\n\nGeraghty has joined the cardiac arrest group, hoping that connecting with others who understand what she's been through will allow her to come to terms with what happened to her that cool spring day six months ago.

But in the week ahead, we shall concentrate on the 40th anniversary of his most extraordinary achievement.\n\n\u2018The Rumble in the Jungle\u2019 sounds like one of those promotional slogans which emerge from a three-bottle lunch. Yet somehow it captured the swaggering audacity of the project which saw the two most celebrated athletes on the planet fight for the richest prize in sport in the small hours of a Kinshasa morning.\n\nMuhammad Ali looks on after knocking down George Foreman in the so-called Rumble in the Jungle\n\nOctober 30, 1974: Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman.\n\nThe heavyweight title was at stake, and the world was captivated.\n\nThe fight was made possible by the President of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, a deeply corrupt human rights abuser, who systematically exploited the nation formerly known as the Congo for more than 30 years. Mobutu paid more than $10million to promote his own image. It was then an unimaginable sum, far more than fighters had ever commanded. But then, he was hiring the very best.\n\nAli was 32 years old and was attempting to regain the title he had lost to Ken Norton more than a year earlier.\n\nAlthough many shared his own opinion that he was the greatest \u2018of ahhhhhl tahm!\u2019, they also suspected that he was past his peak, that after 46 fights his talents were eroding.\n\nAli was brought to Zaire for the fight by the infamous President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko\n\nAli trains in front of a captive audience in\u00a0Kinshasa before a cut to Foreman's eye delayed the fight\n\nAbove and beyond all this lay a widespread conviction that the 25-year-old Foreman was genuinely invincible, a monster, one of the most terrifying punchers the sport had known. He had won the title with a murderous dismantling of Joe Frazier, and he saw Ali as his lucrative victim.\n\n\u2018My opponents don\u2019t worry about losing,\u2019 he said. \u2018They worry about getting hurt.\u2019 It was as near as this malevolent, taciturn presence ever came to humour.\n\nBy dazzling contrast, Ali was a force of nature; bright, funny, endlessly personable and dauntingly handsome.\n\nSomebody once wrote of a fabled heavyweight: \u2018Joe Louis was a newspaperman\u2019s champion. He always finished in time for the first edition, so the guys could get to the bar before closing.\u2019\n\nAli will forever be remembered as the greatest heavyweight boxer in history, but the sport took its toll\n\nAli took a lot of punishment by methodically drawing Foreman in to waste the younger fighter's energy\n\n60,000 roaring fans packed Kinshasa\u2019s outdoor Stade du 20 Mai for the fight.\n\n32 -year-old Ali was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds. It is said that in the dressing room, Foreman and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill Ali.\n\n450 locations in the United States and Canada \u2014 and in some cinemas in the United Kingdom \u2014 screened the fight on closed-circuit television.\n\n100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight, which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in Zaire to accommodate audiences in the US.\n\n10 million dollars was split between the two \u2014 $5m each \u2014 paid for by President Mobutu.\n\n45 Foreman first quit in 1977 and returned in the early Nineties \u2014 winning the world title again at 45, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history.\n\nPerhaps so. But when Ali started to paint his word-pictures, he made the bar seem a poor alternative. Before the Foreman fight, he ran through his repertoire.\n\nHe was contemptuous: \u2018Foreman\u2019s a big old bully from Texas who used to beat up people on the streets.\u2019\n\nHe was dismissive: \u2018Foreman hits hard, sure. But hitting power don\u2019t mean nothing if you can\u2019t find nothing to hit.\u2019\n\nHe spouted yards of his terrible poetry: \u2018You think the world was shocked when Nixon resigned?/Wait till I whup George Foreman\u2019s behind.\u2019 And, right across the world, the public lapped it up.\n\nThere was a false start when a sparring partner\u2019s elbow cut Foreman\u2019s eye and both fighters were required to remain in Zaire for a month while Foreman recovered.\n\nAli spent much of the time storming around town and leading the locals in chants of \u2018Ali, bomaye!\u2019 (Ali, kill him!).\n\nFinally, on October 30, 1974, in the Stade du 20 Mai, before 60,000 people, a bell sounded and a fight began.\n\nAli had the locals in Zaire chanting 'Ali, bomaye', which translated means 'Ali, kill him!'\n\nAli begins returning the heavyweight champion of the world's blows with interest\n\nThe legend has grown, these past 40 years, that Ali offered himself as a target, that he simply lay on the ropes and allowed Foreman to punch himself out.\n\nThe promotional poster for the Rumble in the Jungle\n\nWell, up to a point. Watching the fight through once again this week, it could be seen that for calculated spells, Ali encouraged Foreman to throw those scything punches, most of which were deflected by arms and gloves. But time and again he would cut loose from the ropes with bewildering combinations to the head.\n\nForeman grew increasingly confused, unbearably weary. And all the time, Ali talked to him: \u2018You was sp\u2019osed to be bad, George! Show me something! That all you got, sucker? An\u2019 you gettin\u2019 tired, George. Ain\u2019t no place to get tired ...\u2019\u00a0And then, in the dying seconds of round eight, Ali found the energy and strength to throw the conclusive combination, and Foreman simply crumpled, exhausted, to the floor.\n\nI recall the London cinema erupting in joy and relief as the count finished and the aisles were awash with dancing, jostling figures.\n\nAli had that effect; neutrality was not an option. I remember walking out into the Leicester Square dawn, and thinking I should never see anything quite like that again. And I never did.\n\nHe would have a third fight with Frazier, a vicious battle in which both men inflicted enduring mental and physical damage.\n\nThen, as his resistance began to dissolve, every contest became an ordeal.\n\nForeman puts up his guard as Ali surges forward in what has been described as 'The Match of the Century'\n\nReferee Zack Clayton counts out foreman after Ali puts him on the canvass in the 8th round\n\nOn October 2, 1980, in a casino car park in Las Vegas, I squirmed at ringside as Ali, old beyond his 38 years, was cruelly punished by Larry Holmes.\n\nHe took punch after pounding punch to his unprotected head, but his perverse pride would not allow him to fall. So he stood and accepted his punishment, and the odious leeches who had taken his money and bathed in his glory simply shrugged and moved on.\n\nThe illness which would ultimately devour him took hold. The speech grew slower and thicker, the reactions ponderous, the decline precipitous.\n\nAs his condition became more distressing, it provoked serious moral questions about our readiness to condone such licensed barbarity. After all, if the very best of them could suffer such an excruciating fate, how can boxing hope to protect those who have only their courage to commend them? For many of us, the answer was all too obvious.\n\nAli staged three fights with the legendary Joe Frazier, which left both men physically and mentally damaged\n\nAli's brash style changed the way that sportsmen behaved, although few have backed their arrogance with genius\n\nAli left a tangled legacy. Effectively, he legitimised boasting and strident self-praise. Before Ali, sporting modesty was mandatory; you were diffident in victory, gracious in defeat.\n\nAfter Ali, across all our major sports, the old rules fell into disuse.\n\nWe now see an ordinary footballer celebrate a goal, or a journeyman cricketer a wicket, and all too easily we summon up a vision of a brash young man from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nBut the fact that routinely escapes the capering imposters is that the young man happened to be a genius. For once, it is not too inflated a term to describe what he did and how he did it.\n\nIn this anniversary week, as Ali\u2019s condition grows increasingly hazardous, I shall recall the words of George Foreman, when he made a visit to London two or three years ago.\n\nForeman had escaped the fate which befell Ali.

Facebook also recently released 'local awareness' ads that help local business promote themselves to users (pictured right)\n\nEarlier this week, reports said California-based Yahoo (CEO Marissa Mayer shown making her keynote address in January 2014) is planning to invest \u00a312 million ($20 million) in the three year-old tech startup. If true the investment would value the company at \u00a36 billion ($10 billion)\n\nThe move comes after a similar, albeit much larger, investment in Chinese technology firm Alibaba reaped huge dividends for Yahoo, with its $1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThis latest move, according to the Wall Street Journal, comes as Snapchat starts to seek funding from venture-capital firms, money managers and companies.\n\nEarlier this year Instagram  launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt.\n\nThe app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend.\n\nLike Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video.\n\nHowever, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you\u2019re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends.\n\nThe favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total.\n\nBolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world.\n\nSnapchat may be a key partner to Yahoo as it gets set to release Snapchat Discovery next year.\n\nThis is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app, which will likely become a key source of revenue for Snapchat.\n\nSnapchat Discovery would provide a platform for Yahoo to distribute its own content.\n\nHowever, the \u00a36 billion ($10 billion) valuation of a company that hasn't, yet, monetised its users, has been dubbed a risky proposition.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it hasn\u2019t worked before; Microsoft\u2019s 2007 investment in Facebook valued the then three-year old company at \u00a39.4 billion ($15 billion), and later proved hugely successful.\n\nLast year Snapchat infamously turned down a \u00a31.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook - a decision that left many stunned.\n\nBut the move seems to have paid off, as Snapchat\u2019s owners Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company.\n\nIf the valuation holds true, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of \u00a36 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB.\n\nYahoo's move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byer in August this year.

I collected it up and used it to build the barn.\n\n'I just did it bit by bit. I started small - laying all the stones up and pouring concrete down the back to secure it and it just continued to grow.\n\n'I think I just got a bit carried away really.\n\n'Rather than a modest barn, I started building turrets and dovecots - which were inhabited by lots of birds, including one owl that lived there the whole time I owned the land.\n\nArchitecture: The build features several arches, left, plus tens of hand made windows and turrets, right, all constructed by the artist - who farmed sheep on the land\n\n'Organic': Mr Stokes said he did not draw any plans for the sprawling barn, which he based on a selection of buildings he had liked throughout his life\n\nEnchanting: Through one of the entrances to the barn, left, is a spiral staircase which leads to the top of one of the dovecotes. There is also some detailed stained glass, right, that depicts two autumnal scenes including a badger on the left and a bird flying above the building on the right\n\n'I also had a room up the top where I would sleep during lambing season.\n\n'I\ndidn't draw any plans before hand - it just grew organically. I took \ninspiration from buildings that I had seen during my life that \nlooked like they were part of their surroundings. I like buildings to \nlook like they belong.'\n\nThe \nbarn is split into several different rooms with varying levels. One \nsection - called 'The Hermitage' by Mr Stokes - has several stained \nglass windows, all hand-made by Mr Stokes.\n\n'The windows represent spring, summer, autumn and winter as well as earth, air, fire and water, and are just another nod to the natural world,' Mr Stokes said.\n\nHowever, having spent over a decade on his magical building, Mr Stokes - who said he doesn't know how the build first became known as the Hobbit House - sold up when a quarry opened nearby.\n\nMr Stokes said: 'I don't like it when people call it the Hobbit House. I never made it to look like that. I just call it my barn. There are also apparently rumours that I had a dispute with the planning office - which is utter nonsense. I moved on because of a quarry.\n\n'They found Forest Marble - which is in high demand - near to my land. I knew there would be lots of lorries trundling in and out constantly so I decided to give it all up.\n\n'When I first sold up, I had dreams about it every night. A woman spends nine months carrying a child, but I spent 11 years on the barn. I felt lost without it.\n\n'Although it was a really difficult decision, know I made the right choice. I've moved on and have done other things.\n\nMr Stokes added that he had only been back to the building once since he left in 2000.\n\nInterior: The barn includes a place for Mr Stokes to sleep during lambing season, pictured left, and several examples of the artist's stained glass windows, right\n\nArtistic: This picture shows another window made by Mr Stokes. With its flowers and muted tones, it is suppose to represent the spring months of the year\n\nUnique: Mr Stokes, who calls this yellow-walled section of the build 'The Hermitage', also made several art pieces for the barn, pictured\n\nThe 'Hobbit House' has now become a frequent stop for photographers and explorers looking to capture some of the building's magic.Manchester photographer Dan Circa, 28, took this set of images after he decided to track down the quirky construction.He said: 'Normally buildings like this are built for novelty, but once upon a time this was actually someone\u2019s home.''It felt like I was in a movie like Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, and I half expected a tiny person to ask me what I was doing in there. It has such a magical feel about it.\u201d\n\n'This little hobbit house was amazingly hand built by Colin many years ago his treasured animals.''He built it all on his own, stone by stone and the stained glass windows were all hand painted. 'There was not much inside the building, just an old table and benches made from logs, but it had an enchanting feel to it.'I really enjoy documenting old buildings, and being able to grab a part of history while it\u2019s still there.'\n\nRelocation: Mr Stokes sold the land the property was built on the 2000 when a quarry was built nearby.

At the time his staff claimed he'd been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was actually in Argentina, seeing Chapur, with whom he was having an affair.\n\nThe episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Sanford and wife Jenny were divorced in 2010. He finished his second term as governor in January 2011, after being censured and fined tens of thousands of dollars for ethics violations, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity.\n\nBut he came back, beating out 15 other candidates earlier this year to win the Republican nomination in the race for the vacant House seat. From the start, Sanford was very open about the affair on the campaign trail and made it the subject of his first TV ad.\n\nAnd even with all his political baggage, he was considered the favorite in the race until last month, when court documents revealed his ex-wife had filed complaints against Sanford for trespassing on her property.\n\nSanford told CNN that he didn't want to leave his sons home alone while their mother was away. He's scheduled for a court appearance two days after the election.\n\nNot long after the trespassing story broke, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced it was pulling out of the race and national Democratic groups announced they were throwing more money into the contest.\n\nAnd National Democratic groups jumped in. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and independent pro-Democrat House Majority PAC combined dished out nearly $1 million to defeat Sanford.\n\nThe two groups, as well as Colbert Busch, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch brought up Sanford's 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress.\n\n\"When we talk about fiscal spending and we talk about protecting the taxpayers, it doesn't mean you take that money we saved and leave the country for a personal purpose,\" she said sternly, looking directly at her opponent on stage.\n\nIn South Carolina politics, two very different campaign styles\n\nAnd her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for using \"tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character.\"\n\nThe DCCC and House Majority PAC have also spotlighted the affair in their final ads.\n\n\"I used to be for Mark Sanford, but not any more. He skipped town to be with his mistress on Father's Day. Sanford even asked his wife for permission to have the affair,\" said Mt. Pleasant Republican voter Jennifer Stark in the House Majority PAC commercial.\n\nBut over the past month, another woman also entered the campaign spotlight: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nSanford and his campaign repeatedly tried to tie Colbert Busch to Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections.\n\nOpinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace\n\n\"I've fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country. Maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest is bigger than them or me, it's about two different visions of how we restore America and reign in Washington spending,\" Sanford said, looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide last week.\n\nTwo weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate.\n\nSanford also repeatedly brought up the money that national Democratic groups have poured into the South Carolina race.\n\n\"What it says is, whose voice do you carry when you go to Washington D.C.?\" he said in the debate with Colbert Busch, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that national Democratic groups have spent on the race.\n\nColbert Busch, responding to the Sanford criticism, sought to distance herself from Washington and from national Democrats.\n\n\"No one tells me what to do except the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. So a victory for Elizabeth Colbert Busch is a victory for the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District,\" she told CNN Monday, adding that two-thirds of her contributions have come from within the Palmetto State.\n\nWhile Sanford touted his fiscal conservative record, Colbert Bush campaigned as an independent centrist who would buck President Barack Obama. In her CNN interview, she highlighted where she doesn't see eye to eye with the president.\n\n\"I respectfully disagree with his budget,\" she said, adding that \"we need to vote to repair\" the president's health care law.\n\nEven though they didn't support Sanford, the NRCC congratulated him Tuesday night, and said the results could prove troublesome for House Democrats in 2014.\n\n\"Democrats spent more than $1 million trying to elect a candidate who was backed by the Democrat machine, but at the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch,\" Rep. Greg Walden, NRCC chairman, said in a statement.\n\nBut national Democrats see a silver lining in Colbert Busch's defeat.\n\n\"House Republicans' outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face. Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until Election Day,\" Rep. Steve Israel, DCCC chairman, said in a statement. \"In this deep red Republican district that Mitt Romney won by 18 points, the fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates.\"\n\nSanford has a woman problem\n\nThe congressional seat became vacant when Rep. Tim Scott, who won re-election by 27 percentage points last November, was picked by GOP Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat of Sen. Jim DeMint, who stepped down late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nNo Democrat has held the seat in more than 30 years, and that streak still stands."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 13, 5, 12, 14, 15, 19, 21, 4, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "Crumbs Bakery shuttered all of its 48 remaining locations on Monday.\nIt seemed like an abrupt ending for a company that opened a decade ago to ride the wave of popularity of the sugary treat sparked by the TV series Sex and The City.\nExperts say Crumbs Bakery's bankruptcy was caused by over-expansion.\nTCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago, and Part of its problem is the competition, given the proliferation of frozen yogurt places.\nCompanies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks.\nEntrepreneurs may be eager to open stores selling these products, but there's always the danger that fickle customers will move on to the next thing,' said a Technomic analyst.", "text": "Crumbs Bakery has learned the hard way that building a business on a fad is no cakewalk.\n\nWhen Crumbs, the New York City-based chain that built its business around cupcakes, shuttered all of its 48 remaining locations Monday, it seemed like an abrupt ending for a company that opened a decade ago to ride the wave of popularity of the sugary treat sparked by the TV series Sex and The City.\n\nBut Crumbs' rise and fall isn't surprising when considering the company's dependence on a culinary craze. In fact, it's the latest cautionary tale for businesses that devote their entire menus to variations of a single product.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHarbinger of doom: Crumbs shuttered all its 48 locations a week after the struggling cupcake shop operator was delisted from the Nasdaq\n\nHow Crumbs crumbled: Experts say Crumbs Bakery's bankruptcy was caused by over-expansion at a time when demand for cupcakes leveled off\n\nKrispy Kreme, for instance, expanded rapidly in large part on the cult-like following of its doughnuts. But sales started declining and the company ended up closing some locations.\n\nLast year, restaurant industry researcher Technomic said Krispy Kreme had 249 locations, down from 338 a decade ago. The chain has broadened its menu more recently. Executives at Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary later this week, weren't available for comment.\n\nA similar fate befell Mrs. Fields, which is known for its cookies. The chain has suffered in part because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies, and it was down to 230 stores last year, from 438 a decade ago.\n\nTCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago. Part of the chain's problem is the competition, given the proliferation of frozen yogurt places. A representative for the parent company of Mrs. Fields and TCBY wasn't immediately available.\n\nCompanies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks. For one, trendy products tend to attract competition from big and small players that want to jump on the bandwagon. For instance, Starbucks and Cold Stone Creamery have been trying to capitalize on the cupcake trend with cake pops and ice cream cupcakes, respectively.\n\nWhere it all started: The cupcake craze can be traced back to Sex and the City (pictured), which popularized the frosted mini-cakes sold by Magnolia bakery in the 90s\n\nDiversified: Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies and brownies\n\nBeing beholden to a single item also makes companies more susceptible to customers' whims and changing tastes.\n\nThere's always a new fad: frozen yogurt; chopped salads; freshly squeezed juices, and even gourmet toast. Entrepreneurs may be eager to open stores selling these products, but there's always the danger that fickle customers will move on to the next thing.\n\n'A cupcake shop today can't survive on just cupcakes,' said Darren Tristano, a Technomic analyst.\n\nTo combat the risks, many chains diversify their menus. And several have prospered by moving beyond their flagship products.\n\nDunkin' Donuts, for instance, has been pushing aggressively into specialty drinks and sandwiches, with a focus on boosting sales after its morning rush hour.\n\nAnd Starbucks has introduced a range of new foods and drinks in its cafes, including premium bottled juices and salad boxes. The coffee chain even plans to expand wine and beer offering in evenings to as many as 1,000 locations over the next several years.\n\nMagnolia, another popular New York City cupcake shop, is credited for sparking the cupcake craze after it was featured in Sex and the City.\n\nDownsizing: Krispy Kreme, which celebrates its 77th anniversary this week, had 249 locations last year, down from 338 a decade ago\n\nStreamlined: The chain Mrs Fields took a hit  because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies and closed down nearly half of its 438 storefronts\n\nFreeze out: The frozen yogurt business TCBY had 355 stores last year, down from 1,413 a decade ago, because of stiff competition\n\nThe chain, which opened in 1996, has endured while many of the cupcake shops that opened up in its wake \u2014 including Crumbs \u2014 focused on just cupcakes. That's in part because Magnolia, which now has 7 U.S. locations, offers a variety of desserts, including cakes, pies, cookies, brownies and banana pudding.\n\nSara Gramling, Magnolia's spokeswoman, said the company is learning about the dangers of focusing too heavily on one product, as well as expanding too quickly.\n\n'We'll be mindful of those lessons,' she said.\n\nStill, some chains manage to persevere by carving out a niche where there aren't many competitors; Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon have expanded locations over the years.\n\nAs for Crumbs, the company noted in a statement late Monday that it was evaluating its 'limited remaining options.' That will include a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Crumbs did not provide comment beyond its statement.\n\nWhile some business analysts were quick to conclude that Crumbs\u2019 collapse heralded the end of the decade-long cupcake trend, others suggested that the bakery chain was a special case.\n\nDecade-long fad: Crumbs first opened its doors in March 2003 in Manhattan. The company went public in 2011 but has been suffering as the cupcake boom has deflated\n\nDavid Sax, author of The Tastemakers: Why We\u2019re Crazy for Cupcakes but Fed Up With Fondue, described Crumbs\u2019 failure as \u2018a classic tale of overexpansion and borrowing too much money,\u2019 adding that it was no indicative of the state of the cupcake industry at large, reported the Washington Post.\n\nIn Sax\u2019s retelling of the story, Crumbs\u2019 fatal flaw was that the chain continued opening more and more stores even as demand for cupcakes levelled off. By 2013, the bakery had 70 locations, which brought in less than $650,000 each.\n\nLast cupcake: Before the Crumbs empire crumbled, employees at Likeable Media in New York City bought this sprinkled cupcake from the now-shuttered shop on 42nd Street for $3.95\n\nFour years earlier, each of Crumbs' 25 locations raked in $1.2million in sales.\n\nSax insisted that the frosted mini-cakes have a bright future.\n\n\u2018This is much more a story about one company\u2019s mismanagement of its product line than it is about the hatred or falling off of one particular American pastry,\u2019 he said. \u2018When the housing market crashed in 2007 or 2008, it wasn\u2019t like people stopped investing in real estate.\n\n\u2018The death of Crumbs doesn\u2019t mean the end of every other cupcake bakery.\u2019\n\nThe news of the chain\u2019s bankruptcy comes less than two weeks after the Nasdaq announced it would stop trading Crumbs, which went public in 2011.\n\nCrumbs had seen a steep decline in profitability since its debut on the market: In its quarterly report from March, the company posted an accumulated deficit of $28.8million.\n\nOutside the Crumbs on 42nd Street, near Times Square, disappointment was palpable Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA pregnancy craving brought Neicy Robinson of the Bronx to another Crumbs location before she walked to the Bryant Park store and realized they had all closed.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.

I think that is why people are connecting with this video and story.\u2019\n\nA\n possible cure has been uncovered by researchers Doug McCarty and Haiyan\n Fu of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. They\u2019ve found a\n gene therapy treatment that works in mice, and they hope to try it in \nhumans.\n\nThe money raised\n by the O'Neills will go toward the first human clinical trial, and they\n hope that their daughter will be selected.\n\nThe\n O\u2019Neills know there\u2019s no guarantee Eliza will get into the clinical \ntrial or that it will work, but said they need to try everything they \ncan for their only daughter.\n\nDoctors estimate that Eliza will stop being able to speak in six months.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t want to be two years from now and say as parents that we left anything on the table,\u2019 said Glenn O\u2019Neill.\n\nAnother campaigner raising funds to find a cure for Sanfilippo Syndrome is actor Jonny Lee Miller.\n\nThe\n Elementary star has actively campaigned for more funding since learning\n that a crew member's son, Jonah, was diagnosed with it.\n\n'The answers and the cures are right around the corner,' Miller told CBS.\n\n'There\u2019s just not enough money going into this right now, and we\u2019re talking about little kids.'\n\nMiller has addressed a congressional caucus in Washington on behalf of rare disease organizations.\n\nHe is an advocate for the Jonah Just Begun Foundation and will be running in the North Face Bear Mountain Run in Bear Mountain, New York on May 4 and 5 for Jonah and for Jonah Just Begun."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 13, 15, 19, 23, 4, 5, 21, 12, 14], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], "summary": "Guilty: Samantha Kidd changed her plea and admitted four counts of assault against her estranged husband Estranged: Samantha Kidd with husband Eddie in 2011.\nEddie Kidd's estranged wife was shielded by supporters as she left Brighton Magistrates' Court at an earlier hearing Support: Marjorie Kidd, the mother of former stuntman Eddie Kidd, arrives at Brighton Magistrates' Court for an earlier hearing of the case", "text": "Guilty: Samantha Kidd changed her plea and admitted four counts of assault against her estranged husband\n\nThe estranged wife of former motorcycle stunt rider Eddie Kidd has admitted hitting the severely disabled star.\n\nSamantha Kidd, 44, pleaded guilty to four counts of assaulting her wheelchair-bound husband yesterday, including slapping him across the face and calling him a \u2018complete spastic\u2019.\n\nThe former James Bond stuntman, 54, was left in a coma for three months in 1996 after suffering brain damage when a jump went wrong.

The nuclear reactor is not what most Vietnamese think of when they think of Dalat. The town, nestled in pine woods, is Vietnam's favorite honeymoon spot.\n\nHighly enriched uranium rods are laid out on a table at the research institute in Dalat, Vietnam.\n\nThe institute is not a romantic place. Located in a cylindrical, concrete building, it contains a 500-kilowatt, pool-type reactor that had only recently been loaded with Soviet WWR-M2 fuel assemblies.\n\nBuilt in 1963 with U.S. help, it originally contained highly enriched uranium from the United States.\n\nIn 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, the reactor was closed, then reconstructed by the Soviet Union. In 1983, it reopened, this time using Soviet highly enriched uranium -- a Cold War marriage made in heaven.\n\nThe institute created medical isotopes and carried out research, but few people if any, in those days thought about the possibility that terrorists might take an interest in the uranium.  Watch experts remove nuclear fuel and show how easily terrorists could hide it \u00bb\n\nAs I was soon to see for myself, fresh, highly enriched uranium is easy to smuggle. When clad with aluminum, its radiation is detectable only by specialized sensors. Approximately 25 kilograms are all that is needed to make a crude nuclear device.\n\nI had never heard of Dalat when, sitting at my desk in Washington last July, I got a call from a contact at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nA dream I had had several years ago, when I was working in Moscow as CNN's bureau chief was about to come true: CNN was given the green light to be the only television network invited to shoot a secret joint U.S./Russian mission to remove the HEU fuel from the Dalat reactor.\n\nThe Vietnamese government, once a U.S. enemy, had agreed to give up its HEU in exchange for converting the reactor to low-enriched uranium that cannot be used for a bomb.\n\nMy contact gave few details over the phone. I went to the Department of Energy for a closed-door briefing.\n\nCNN cameraman Charlie Miller and I would travel to Ho Chi Minh City, where we would meet the Department of Energy staff, then fly to Dalat and drive to the reactor.\n\nAccording to DOE ground rules, we would be able to share only a few details of the operation with our senior editors. The timing of the actual transfer of the HEU was classified. We would learn it only after we had arrived in Vietnam. We would not be able to broadcast our report until the nuclear material was back in Russia.\n\nAfter our arrival in Ho Chi Minh City September 11, we, along with a U.S. and a Japanese newspaper reporter, met the other members of the team: two Russian nuclear experts and a representative from the International Atomic Energy Agency -- the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations -- who were to certify completion of the transfer.\n\nAfter a short flight to Dalat, we loaded into a van and set out on the serpentine road toward the research institute, passing ribbons of Vietnamese on motor scooters, the primary mode of transportation here.\n\nAt the gate, a color poster of Ho Chi Minh greets us. Inside, we don yellow lab coats, cover our shoes with blue throw-away slippers and enter the cavernous room where the reactor stands, towering over us like something out of \"Dr. Strangelove.\"\n\nThe HEU fuel rods have been removed from the reactor and are stored in a large metal case. A Vietnamese scientist fumbles with the keys, then opens the top and begins handing the rods to the Russian experts, who lay them out on a table.\n\nThe experts are wearing dosimeters to measure the radiation, but only one person wears gloves -- simple, rough cotton ones. They hand me a fuel rod and I hold it in my bare hands. Now I understand just how easy it would be for a terrorist to disguise the fact that he or she was carrying highly enriched uranium. The fuel rod looks for all the world like an aluminum leg to a small table.\n\nThe experts lead us up steep metal stairs to the top of the reactor. I peer down into the pool of water into which a technician is lowering new fuel rods made of low-enriched uranium. Unlike highly enriched uranium, this fuel cannot be used to make a bomb.\n\nThe Vietnamese are willing to cooperate, but they also want to verify that this new fuel will work as well as the HEU did. In the control room, they huddle in front of a wall of electronic gauges, waiting until the reactor reaches \"criticality.\"\n\nAs a blue gauge hits the mark, the room fills with applause. Professor Vuong Huu Tan, chairman of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission, tells me \"the most important part of the reactor is training our people in nuclear energy.\"\n\nThis is the other part of the equation: By complying with the U.S./Russian effort to remove vulnerable nuclear materials, Vietnam assures it will get international support for its quest to build nuclear power plants to generate energy. Both U.S. and Russian companies are eyeing Vietnam as a potential market.\n\nThe Russians wrap the fuel rods in plastic, then insert them into two large, steel cylinders. The IAEA expert seals them. If they're tampered with, it will be obvious.\n\nThe next day, a flatbed military truck backs into the reactor room. A crane lifts the cylinders and gently lays them on the truck's wooden bed as a Vietnamese military officer, in olive drab, looks on.\n\nThe final and most vulnerable phase of the operation begins. The truck drives through the reactor gates and joins a convoy guarded by armed soldiers. Sirens blaring, we set out in a slow procession, weaving down the mountain road, traffic police on motorcycles waving riders on motor scooters out of the way.\n\nAt Dalat's airport, the truck wheels onto the tarmac and stops near a Vietnamese military helicopter. A forklift lowers the cylinders to the ground and six soldiers heave them in slings to the helicopter.\n\nFrom there, they are flown to the military base at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where they are put onto a Russian transport plane. Until the last moment, it is unclear whether the Vietnamese military will allow journalists onto the base. As one soldier tells a member of the nuclear team, \"the last time Americans were here was when you bombed us.\"\n\nBut they do let us in. \"No pictures outside. Just inside the plane.\" We climb the stairs into the belly of the Ilyushin 76 and see the two baby-blue cylinders filled with highly enriched uranium, nestled side by side, like two children of the Cold War, ready for a trip back to where they came from: Russia.\n\nAt 2 p.m., right on schedule, the engines roar and the plane lumbers down the runway, off to its ultimate destination in the Ural Mountains. There, the HEU will be blended into a form that cannot be used for bomb-making.\n\nMy instincts tell me to grab a phone and call CNN headquarters in Atlanta to report that the plane has taken off, but the embargo is strict: no broadcast until the HEU is safely back on Russian soil.\n\nOn the sweltering tarmac at a military base in Ho Chi Minh City, as the plane rises in the sky, the team of nuclear experts, the Vietnamese soldiers and even we reporters break into applause. Three countries: Russia, the United States and Vietnam, intertwined in a complex page of history, brought together in a mission to make the world more secure.\n\nThis is the 13th such mission carried out by the United States and Russia. Altogether, a total of 442 kilograms of fresh HEU from 11 countries, enough to build more than 17 crude nuclear devices, have been removed. But there is more to be done. The two countries still are only halfway there in securing vulnerable nuclear materials around the world.

Appeals court challengers said in a court filing.\n\n'Major economic decisions like these - indeed, any decisions granting tax credits - must be made unambiguously by Congress itself.'\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety.\n\n'It is pretty obvious what the congressional intent was here,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, which was for every qualified American to receive a subsidy 'regardless of whether it was state officials or federal officials running the marketplace.'\n\nPierce said the D.C. ruling is 'at odds with the goal of the law.'\n\n'We believe that this decision is incorrect, inconsistent with \nCongressional intent,' the Justice Department official said.\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers to the law are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety\n\nAn appeals court filing by congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act, similarly argues that 'Congress did not provide that the tax credits would only be available to citizens whose states set up their own exchanges.'\n\nCongressional lawmakers and state legislators who are against the law hope that by limiting the subsidies to state exchanges, they can destabilize important aspects of the law, such as the individual mandate requiring most people to buy insurance.\n\nAndre \nDavis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge serving on the Richmond court, explained the court's decision this way:\n\n'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would\n be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham \nand pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from \nDomino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a \nliteral construction of my lunch order.'\n\nDavis and his colleagues voted to uphold what the Obama administration says was the 'intent' of law - subsidies for all qualified Americans, regardless of whether they signed up for coverage through the state or federal exchanges.\n\n'Today\u2019s ruling highlights the ramifications of hastily passing legislation before fully knowing and understanding what it entails and how it will affect people,' House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers said in a statement after the D.C. decision was handed down.\n\n'For months, people all across this country have seen firsthand the flawed and ineffective implementation of Obamacare \u2013 in their skyrocketing premiums, lost coverage, limited access, and regulatory inefficiencies.\n\n'And today\u2019s decision is only further evidence of the legislation\u2019s failure,' the GOP leader said.' It\u2019s time to listen to the American people, enact real health care reforms, and start over. This law does not work.'\n\nAndre \nDavis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge who wrote a concurring opinion on the Richmond court's decision, said he was not going to allow anti-Obamacare advocates to use the court to deny 'millions of Americans desperately-needed health insurance.'\n\nDavis admitted that the federal law was 'tortured' and it's construction was 'nonsensical' but it's 'manifest purpose, as revealed by the wholeness and coherence of its text and structure, could not be more clear.'\n\nIn an attempt to explain the law in lay terms, Davis offered up an equally tortured pizza-based analogy.\n\n'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would\n be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham \nand pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from \nDomino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a \nliteral construction of my lunch order,' he said.\n\nJudges on the D.C. case were Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush; A. Raymond Randolph, an appointee of Bush's father; and Harry Edwards, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, who dissented.\n\nA lower court had ruled that the law's text, structure, purpose, and legislative history make 'clear that Congress intended to make premium tax credits available on both state-run and federally-facilitated Exchanges.'\n\nBut the appeals court concluded the opposite - that the letter of the law 'unambiguously restricts' the law's subsidies to policies sold through exchanges established by the state.\n\n'An Exchange established by the federal government cannot possibly be \"an Exchange established by the State,\" ' Randolph wrote in a concurring opinion. 'To hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation.\n\n'Only further legislation could accomplish the expansion the government seeks.'\n\nIn a statement celebrating the D.C. court's decision, Sam Kazman, general counsel for the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, one of the organization's responsible for \nfunding the lawsuit said, 'The court\u2019s decision puts an end to the power grab that the IRS rule represented.\n\n'And more importantly it reaffirms the fact that we are a nation of laws enacted by Congress rather than rules issued by agenda-driven agencies,' Kazman added.\n\n'Despite all the political calls for the country to 'get with the program and support Obamacare,\" it\u2019s the Framers of the Constitution who have the last word.'"}, {"annotators_ids": [4, 13, 14, 19, 5, 6, 12, 15, 21, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Back in jail: Ricky Preddie (left) was released from Pentonville prison but was last night recalled for breaching the terms of his licence.\nOnly six months later he was recalled after returning to the Peckham estates he terrorised as a boy in breach of his licence.\nMr Taylor, 64, had previously pleaded with the authorities not to release Ricky Preddie or his brother Danny, both of whom were jailed for eight years for Damilola\u2019s manslaughter in 2006.", "text": "Damilola Taylor\u2019s father demanded a public inquiry yesterday after one of his son\u2019s killers was recalled to jail \u2013 only 16 days after being freed.\n\nRicky Preddie was arrested on Thursday night after entering a South London estate to meet up with fellow gang members, breaching the terms of his release.\n\nIt is the second time he has been released then recalled for breaking the conditions of his licence.

ANZAC biscuits and tobacco were also gifted to those fighting.\n\nAs they didn't have the opportunity to actively participate in the war, women found other ways to throw their support behind the troops\n\nWives and mothers assumed what were known as comfort roles during WWI while looking after the household and children\n\nMore than 60,000 Australian men lost their lives during battle, pictured here are soldiers in Liverpool, NSW before they departed\n\nWomen enjoyed a greater sense of autonomy within society while scores of men were on the battlefields\n\nIn the home the women stepped up into traditionally male roles, and had a greater sense of autonomy within society.\n\n'In many households women took the dual role of mother and head of the household in the absence of men', Professor Macintyre said. However when, or if, the men returned, there was a strong push towards restoring traditional gender roles.\n\nProfessor Macintyre, who is one of Australia's most influential public intellectuals, whose most widely known work is the History of Wars, which focuses on various aspects of war history in Australia but also worldwide.\n\nHowever they were expected to move back in to traditional gender roles once, or if, the men returned\n\nOne in ten soldiers, seen here cleaning their rifles in the trenches, never made it home\n\nThe Red Cross was one of the charities which many women volunteered for\n\nPost-war, despite the expectation for women to assume their gendered roles, some war widows would not have that opportunity and would be raising their children as single parents.\n\nSmall towns were left with gaping holes in their populations when men didn\u2019t return and people often lost many men from the one family.\n\nThere were also the husbands and sons who returned from battle so damaged that they simply couldn't cope with the demons from war and were unable to care for themselves, let alone their offspring.\n\nMany men who returned suffered deep physical and mental scars from the war\n\nReunions were held at the end of the war, like this one in Georgetown, South Australia"}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 13, 4, 15, 19, 5, 12, 14, 21, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "In a move likely to infuriate Senate Republicans, President Barack Obama's national security adviser Tom Donilon is resigning to be replaced by U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, marking a significant shakeup to the White House foreign policy team.\nRice is to become President Barack Obama's national security adviser, it was reported today Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice performing her role - it has been announced today that she will take over as President Obama's National Security Advise", "text": "In a move likely to infuriate Senate Republicans, President Barack Obama's national security adviser Tom Donilon is resigning to be replaced by U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, marking a significant shakeup to the White House foreign policy team.\n\nA White House official confirmed the personnel changes Wednesday morning ahead of a planned announcement by the president later at 2.30 p.m. in the Rose Garden.\n\nDonilon has been a key foreign policy adviser to Obama since he first took office.

Rice is to become President Barack Obama's national security adviser, it was reported today\n\nRice, a close Obama confidante, came under withering criticism from Republicans as part of the investigations into the deadly terror attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nFour Americans were killed in the attack, including the U.S. ambassador, Christopher Stevens.\n\nShe appeared on five Sunday shows \nafter the September 11th, 2012 attack and claimed the Benghazi consulate\nraid was triggered by protests over an anti-Islam film.\n\nThe\nObama administration later acknowledged there were in fact no protests \nat the consulate although they have tried to claim that protests else \nthat may have excited the situation.\n\nLast\nmonth, under massive pressure from the media, the White House released \nthe infamous 'talking points' that Rice was meant to stick to when \ndiscussing the attack - which led to the death of the U.S. ambassador \nChristopher Stevens.\n\nThe \nemails revealed the drafting and radical re-drafting of the \nadministrations storyline in anticipation of Rice's appearances on \ntelevision.\n\nThe CIA, led at the time by David Petraeus wanted to include references to militant threats from Islamic extremists - but ultimately these were removed after objections from various White House figures.\n\nWhile it is not clear what level of involvement Rice had in the evolution of the 'talking points', officials speaking in her defense said that she was only reiterating the information she was handed.\n\nBy promoting Rice, President Obama opens himself up to charges of rewarding those associated with the ongoing Benghazi controversy.\n\nOutgoing U.N.

'That's my biggest dream and it always has been. He came across as a very kind man, a very good man, and I trusted him.'\n\nThe pair, who had planned to co-parent the children, decided to use in-vitro fertilization with anonymous donor eggs for the pregnancy.

He has temporary custody\n\nWhen she found out earlier this year that, after two rounds of IVF, she was pregnant with twins, 'I was absolutely thrilled,' Close said. 'I always wanted twins.'\n\nBut feelings of joy were quickly replaced with betrayal when she gave birth to a boy and a girl in July - and McMurrey told her he was taking the children.\n\n'The social worker came to me and said we \nhad a surrogate situation,' she said. '[The worker] claimed I was a surrogate for him and his\ndomestic partner that I didn't even know he had.'\n\nHe became so enraged when he saw Close breastfeeding the children in hospital, he took out a restraining order against her, she said.\n\nBetrayal: After the birth, Marvin McMurrey (left) told Close he was gay and the babies would be brought up by him and his partner, Phong Nguyen (right). The children are currently staying with Nguyen\n\nBattle: Close said that even though she used donor eggs to get pregnant there was never a surrogate contract\n\nCindy Close's case is complicated as a doctor advised her to use donor eggs due to her age, so she is not the children's biological mother.\n\nMarvin McMarrey claims she was a surrogate, but typically, a contract must be agreed and the mother and father are spelled out if this is the case.\n\nHowever, attorneys said Texas law does not exclude other arrangements for surrogates, which is an issue the courts may take up here.\n\nIn normal surrogate cases, the intended mother's eggs are used inside a different woman. Even though the intended mother does not carry the children, she is legally the 'mother' due to an agreement. In this case, an anonymous donor was used and the child would have no legal mother, as is required.\n\nAn issue that could also work \nagainst McMurrey, who wants to bring up the children with his gay partner, is that the intended parents have to be married for a\nsurrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state.\n\nTraditional surrogacy - where parents use a surrogate woman's eggs and body to carry a child - is not recognised in Texas.\n\nMcMurrey filed a lawsuit against \nClose in August, demanding he be named as the father as she was simply a\nsurrogate and had no rights.\n\nHe has temporary custody of the children, and they are now living with McMurrey's partner, Phong Nguyen - even though the father does not live there.\n\nClose said she is only allowed to see \nher children for two hours a day on Monday to Friday, and claims the \ncouple has placed cameras in the room to watch her as she holds her \nbabies.\n\n'I only ever wanted to be a mom and... after giving me my dream, he's taking that away,' she said, breaking down in tears.\n\nThe courts will now determine what rights Close has as she struggles to define in legal terms what it means to be a mother.\n\n'We've alleged he duped Cindy into have \nher children on the basis on him attempting to have her declared a \nsurrogate once they were born,' her attorney, Grady Reiff, said.\n\nHe\nexplained that, in Texas, the mother does not need to prove she is the \nparent but McMurrey must prove Close was a surrogate. They never signed a\ncontract or agreement, he said.\n\n'This was not a surrogacy, so it never \noccurred to me that I would ever need a written agreement,' Close told the Houston Chronicle. 'If anything, I thought he would lose \ninterest because I didn't expect him to be a very involved father.'\n\nReiff\nadded: 'It's our position that a woman who gives\nbirth is the mother, unless there is a [surrogate] agreement.' If \nMcMurrey had his way, the children would have no legal 'mother'.\n\nTaking a stand: Attorney Grady Reiff said Cindy was duped and McMurrey must prove she was a surrogate\n\nIn surrogate cases, the intended \nmother's eggs are used and, while she does not carry the child, she is \nthe 'mother' because of the agreement.\n\nIn Texas, it's not the mother's burden to prove she is the parent, Reiff, said, so the onus is now on McMurrey to prove Close was a surrogate.\n\nAnother issue that could work \nagainst McMurrey is that the intended parents have to be married for a\nsurrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state.\n\n'The father is arguing a very technical \nlegal position,' Jim Paulsen, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said. 'But it's one of those cases that you \nhope the judge will be able to look at more than just preliminary \ntechnical matters.'\n\nMcMurrey's attorney, Ellen Yarrell, did not comment on the case.

the same as a spec of dust - is enough to kill someone, due to its slowly-excreted alpha particles which affect the body's organs.\n\nAfter ingestion, Polonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract.\n\nSerious illness would not be expected for a month, due to the amount of time it takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures.\n\nAs the severity of the exposure develops in the body, victims usually lose hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed.\n\nThis later leads to severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, loss of fluids, and disturbance of electrolyte balance.\n\nThough it takes 5-6 weeks to seriously affect most, the symptoms of Polonium poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko (above), who fell ill the day after he was exposed.\n\nThe Russian died 23 days after being exposed, an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage.\n\nBochud said the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210.\n\n'But we have to do it quite fast because \npolonium is decaying, so if we wait too long, for sure, any possible \nproof will disappear,' he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIt emerged today that Palestinians are ready to accept a medical examination of Arafat's body if his family agrees, according to a Palestinian official.\n\nThe comments from Tawfiq Tirawi, who led a Palestinian probe into Arafat's death, came just hours after the Al-Jazeera investigation showed the Palestinian leader might have been poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium.\n\nThe official told AP: 'After the Al-Jazeera broadcast I met today with president (Mahmud) Abbas and recommended accepting an analysis of the body of the martyr president Arafat, and Abbas for his part agreed on the condition that the family... accepts.'\n\nPolonium was found to have caused the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, and he was assumed to have been deliberately poisoned.\n\nArafat's widow Suha said she would ask for Arafat's body - buried in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian self-rule authority - to be exhumed.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the documentary, aired on Al Jazeera's English and Arabic channels, she said: 'We have to go further and exhume Yasser Arafat's body to reveal the truth to all the Muslim and Arab world.'\n\nArafat led the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's fight against Israel from the 1960s but signed a peace agreement with the Jewish state in 1993 establishing Palestinian self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nHis mysterious death came four years into a Palestinian uprising, after years of talks with Israel failed to lead to a Palestinian state.\n\nFrench doctors who treated Arafat in his final days could not establish the cause of death.\n\nFrench officials refused to give details of his condition, citing privacy laws, fuelling a host of rumours and theories over the nature of his illness."}, {"annotators_ids": [19, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 4, 21, 23], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "The 17-year-old from Artane in Dublin is in a coma after passing out when the joke went wrong.\nThe incident happened on Thursday when a group of teenagers were joking about on their lunch break.\nA 17-year-old boy passed out and suffered a suspected heart attack after his testicles were squeezed as part of a prank that went wrong close to St David's CBS in Dublin Doctors treating the boy at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin put the teenager into an induced coma.", "text": "An Irish teenager is in a coma after suffering a suspected heart attack when his testicles were tugged and squeezed as part of a prank.\n\nThe 17-year-old from Artane in Dublin is in a coma after passing out when the joke went wrong.\n\nThe incident happened on Thursday when a group of teenagers were joking about on their lunch break.\n\nA 17-year-old boy passed out and suffered a suspected heart attack after his testicles were squeezed as part of a prank that went wrong close to St David's CBS in Dublin\n\nThe Irish Mirror reported the boy was on his way back to St David's CBS in the city when he bumped into a group of classmates.\n\nIt is understood the fifth-year student was joking about with the group when someone 'jerked his scrotum'.\n\nA source close to the family said the incident was 'not malicious', adding that they hope the teen has not suffered any permanent damage.\n\nA school teacher and one of the teenagers performed CPR, while they waited for the emergency services to arrive at the scene.\n\nThe boy was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and on Friday, he was reported to be in a stable condition.\n\nDoctors treating him, put the teenager into an induced coma.\n\nThe Irish police force, the Gardai, have launched an investigation.

house.\n\nWith Sienna Miller, Harry Styles, Naomi Harris, Suki Waterhouse and Paloma Faith watching from the front row, Christopher Bailey showed a feminine, genteel collection \u2013 he described it as \u2018tender\u2019 - replete with Victorian lace in soft macar\u00f3n hues of mint and rose, mauve and lavender, gentle shapes that borrowed just enough from the archives, the occasional graphic print in black and white or a splash of red, and a (sometimes liberal) sprinkling of bling.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nRound of applause: The petal-strewn finale of Christopher Bailey's blockbuster show at Burberry Prorsum in Kensington Gardens\n\nEver the innovator with fabric, \nBailey discovered a factory in the North of England that still had \nVictorian lace machines in full working order \u2013 and he used them to \ncreate featherlight pencil skirts and dresses in pale pistachio, cream \nand the faintest whisper of mauve.\n\nBut, this being Bailey, he also took \nthis most traditional of fabrics and breathed modern life into it, \ntinting it black and white stripes or turning it into a trench-inspired \nshirt dress.\n\nPencil skirts \nprevailed, coming in that beautiful Nottingham lace, baby soft cashmere that draped at the hips and gathered into a twisted knot at the front (office wear for those too wealthy to work) as well as vivid monochrome \nstripes \u2013 which was paired with a spot shirt set surely to take over from the heart print\n as the piece that makes it to the mainstream ( I spotted at least 20 people wearing THAT heart shirt at the show today).\n\nThanks\n to Bailey\u2019s love of Scottish cashmere, the Burberry girl will be kept \nwarm next spring with baby soft, slouchy cardigans in grey, mint and \npink.\n\nOuterwear was softer in general. Light cashmere overcoats in pale grey or white, a single-breasted coat in dusky pink.\n\nThe trench in its most traditional form - beige, gabardine, belted - was entirely absent. \nInstead, Bailey said, he wanted to introduce the elements of the trench \nbut in a gentler way.\n\nThat \nmeant stripping out the lining, using softer fabrics, softer shapes, and more generous\n cuts that enveloped and cocooned the figure rather than necessarily cinching it.\n\nSorbet: Bailey plumped for a hugely pretty palette with sugary shades of pistachio, lemon, candyfloss and delicate almond dominating\n\nAlways soulful, haunting, epic. Playlist was: Benjamin Twine, by George Ezra. Man On The Moon by Jake Bugg. When We Were On Fire (The Mahogany Sessions) by James Bay. Budapest by George Ezra. Bailey does the hard work so we can download and discover them.\n\n'I wanted this idea of everything being much more soft, \nmuch more gentle,' he said after the show. 'I liked the idea of taking out all the linings, all \nbut the most essential part of the trench.\n\nI liked the idea of taking the traditional trench coat, the iconic \nBurberry trenchcoat but then reimagining it with these soft, fluid \nfabrics. So we used a lot of double-faced cashmeres, we used a lot of \nsilks, so that everything had a very natural flow.\n\n'Fabric is the\n DNA of our brand,' he added. 'Thomas Burberry, our founder, invented gabardine, and\n it's something care about greatly. We have a whole team of people and \nall they do is work through the innovation, craftsmanship and \nconstruction of fabric.\n\n'Everything was soft and feminine and had that sense of kind of wrapping yourself in things.\n\n'There was kind of tenderness, a vulnerability.'\n\nThe colour palette - those dusky pinks and greens, palest yellow, sugary soft hues, were borne of Bailey's love of the English rose - hence the thousands of petals that rained down on the catwalk during the finale.\n\n'I wanted the colours to be soft and gentle, like sugared flowers,' Bailey said.\n\n'We've\n been talking about this English rose and the breadth and depth of the \ncolours. We tried to distill that, so there's a powderiness to the \ncolours as well as them just being pastel.'\n\nTrench detail was borrowed and used elsewhere. A\n deep sage coat-dress had a scoop neck that echoed the traditional lapel\n of the trench, a mint-green filigree shirt-dress used trench detailing at the \nback and trench lapels; Cara D walked in a transparent trench cape dotted with dusky pink \nbeading.\n\nElegant: Jourdan Dunn walked the runway in a draped skirt and sheer mint blouse\n\nSweet: Pink once again proved a popular choice and looks set to be a huge hit next summer\n\nEmbellished: Cara D modelled a cape in clear plastic embellished with gems down the runway\n\nPals: Harry Styles, in leopard print Burberry shirt, watches friend and long-time Burberry model Cara Delevingne walk the runway in dusky rose lace\n\nThe\n mood was certainly gentler than previous seasons (especially given that\n last season PVC pencil skirts were the look of the season). It was, \nsaid Bailey, meant to be warm, soft and a little bit romantic.\n\n\u2018I\n wanted the show to be gentle, to feel enveloping,\u2019 he said afterwards. \n\u2018I wanted it to have a real crafted feeling, something that \nfelt you were really cocooned and protected. It was very feminine, \ngentle and soft. But there was a sassiness and a sexiness underneath, \nand I like that idea of strength and fragility.\u2019\n\nCara Delevingne walked, as did \nJourdan Dunn. It is, Bailey agreed, important to have those big names \nwalking. In truth though, Cara has been part of the Burberry gang long \nbefore she was the \u2018model of the moment'.\n\n'We\n have always loved Cara,\u2019 Bailey said fondly, as the lady herself leapt around backstage \nwearing a balaclava and giving out bearhugs. \u2018She\u2019s part of the Burberry\n family.\n\n'We have worked with Cara for many, many years,' he added. 'She's someone I'm very close to. We have a wonderful relationship. I just adore Cara, she's beautiful.\n\nSoft with underlying sassiness: Cocooning overcoats, delicate lace, macrame and silk. Trench coats had lining stripped out, softer material was used\n\nGraphic: Despite a genteel colour palette and the softness of lace elsewhere, Bailey made sure to maintain his trademark sassiness with cheeky prints\n\nSnappers: Alexa Chung, Poppy Delevingne and Jamal Edwards take in the graphic prints that shot through the pastels\n\nRomantic: A softer aesthetic at Burberry today - in contrast to the rubber skirts of last season - though there was a sense of sassiness too. 'Both fragility and strength.' said Bailey\n\nFrom left: Alison Mosshart, Paloma Faith, Sienna Miller, Harry Styles and Suki Waterhouse\n\nIt's one of London Fashion Week's \nbiggest draws and this season's outing from Burberry proved to be no \nexception. The cream of London's style set - as well as heavy hitters from around the world - turned out to see the latest effort from Christopher Bailey at the Kensington Gardens show.\n\nAmong the biggest of the big names was US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who joined Topshop supremo Sir Phillip Green and socialite Olivia Palermo on the front row.\n\nCelebrities paying Bailey the compliment of wearing Burberry to the show included Sienna Miller, who wore a black felt dress from the A/W13 collection and One Direction singer Harry Styles who plumped for a daring \u00a3395 leopard print military shirt.\n\nDonna Air also turned out in Burberry, choosing a stylish crocodile pencil skirt and a soft nappa leather tank. She was joined by actress Gabriella Wilde, the half-sister of Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas, and 21-year-old model, Suki Waterhouse.\n\nRounding off the stellar front row was Alexa Chung, model Arizona Muse and flame-haired singer Paloma Faith who was resplendent in - of course - a chic Burberry skirt.\n\nFashion on the Burberry FROW: Paloma Faith,Sienna Miller, Harry Styles and Suki Waterhouse seemed to be enjoying themselves as they waited for the show to begin\n\nStylish: New York socialite Olivia Palermo was elegant in a black jacket and skirt while Anna Wintour was her usual fashionable self in delicate duck egg blue\n\nBurberry fans: Sienna Miller (above) has appeared in Burberry fashion campaigns while Harry Styles - who recently wore the much-loved heart-print shirt - chose a \u00a3395 animal print shirt\n\nGolden girl: It girl and erstwhile TV presenter Donna Air had a ringside seat at Burberry\n\nFeeling blue: Burberry girl and actress Gabriella Wilde\n\nBradley's girl: Model Suki Waterhouse looked thrilled as she enjoyed Burberry from the sidelines\n\nEnglish Rose: British model Cara Delevingne with classic sleek hair\n\nAn edgier version of the classic English rose was Christopher Kane's beauty vision at Burberry and lead stylist Neil Moodie was the man asked to provide it.\n\n'Christopher Bailey\u2019s inspiration for the collection is English Rose distressed,' explained the hair guru. 'This is why I decided to blow dry the hair in a classic sleek - but not poker straight - as would be expected of an English Rose. I then texturised and mattified the hair with Moroccanoil products to give it an edgy, distressed look.'\n\nMoodie began by preparing wet hair with a Moroccanoil treatment before adding the brand's Frizz Control to make sure hair stayed beautifully smooth. 'Next, I applied Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream before blow drying the hair to ensure the movement created by the blow dry held and to give it a more luxury finish,' explained Neil.\n\nLuckily for those who want to recreate the look, it's one that works with any hair type. 'For thick hair, I blowdried it with a natural centre parting,' adds Neil. 'For long hair, I created some movement by flicking the ends under in a natural way.'\n\nOnce the hair was dry, it was divided it into sections and finished with Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray and Moroccanoil Volumising Mousse to add texture and create a matte finish.'\n\nNeil added: 'Before the models went on to the catwalk, the hair was tucked into the coats, and few stray sections were released at the back and side.'\n\nBeauty was created by Wendy Rowe using Burberry and introducing the Spring/Summer colours and Burberry nails."}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 19, 23], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "summary": "A girl of seven was secretly bitten by a tour guide in Thailand when she refused to let him kiss her.\nThe girl's mother is suing her travel agency in China over the attack, which occurred during a six-day trip to Thailand that was a reward for the girl's good grades in school.\nOnce she returned to China she complained to the travel agency, and an investigation in Thailand allegedly found that another tourist saw the the guide ask the little girl for a kiss.\nThe girl's mother has had her daughter tested in case she was infected with any diseases by the bites", "text": "A girl of seven was secretly bitten by a tour guide in Thailand when she refused to let him kiss her.\n\nThe girl's mother is suing her travel agency in China over the attack, which occurred during a six-day trip to Thailand that was a reward for the girl's good grades in school.\n\nChen Ting, 36, said daughter Chen Yin had seemed unusually quiet during the trip, and on the final day as they waited at the airport before flying home, the girl began crying and complaining that her arm and stomach were hurting.\n\nInjury: The girl's mother holds up a picture of the alleged bitemark on her daughter's arm\n\nMrs Chen then found bite marks on her daughter, and discovered that Chinese tour guide Zhou Fang was allegedly responsible.\n\n'At the time I clearly saw some teeth marks on my daughter's left arm, the skin in the area was abraded, the same with her belly,' she told People's Daily Online.\n\nWhen Ms Chen complained to the guide, she claimed he refused to apologise and simply walked away.\n\nOnce she returned to China she complained to the travel agency, and an investigation in Thailand allegedly found that another tourist saw the the guide ask the little girl for a kiss.\n\nIn her complaint letter, the mother said: 'When I saw my daughter in tears and listened to her story, I checked and found obvious bite marks in places where she couldn't have done it herself.\n\n'She said the guide had bitten her after telling her: \"You are very pretty.

PGP was one of the first military-grade encryption products available to the general public.\n\nIt was in those cases, the committee's report\u00a0 said, that the surveillance devices would come in handy.\n\n'It\n is important for the agencies that there is some means of accessing \ncommunications data from uncooperative overseas communications service \nproviders,' the report said.\n\nThe report said the probes would \nwork using 'deep packet inspection,' so-called because it allows those \nintercepting packets of data to comb through their content.\n\nThe\n services that might be targeted by the probes weren't identified, \nalthough Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Google Chat are all popular in \nBritain and were among the services named elsewhere in the report.\n\nBritain's surveillance plans remain in draft form, and the report carried several critiques of the government's proposals.\n\nBut in general it rejected opponents' claims that the surveillance regime was unworkable or oppressive, warning that the pace of technological change would soon 'have a serious impact on the intelligence and security agencies' unless the new surveillance powers were introduced.\n\nThe report also appeared to reject suggestions that encryption might allow those trying to maintain the privacy of their communications to baffle government monitoring.\n\n'We have heard that the government has (redacted) options in dealing with the challenge encryption poses,' the report said.\n\nThe next two paragraphs were completely blanked out.\n\nMr Killock of the Open Rights Group said it was unlikely that the government had the capability to crack advanced digital encryption."}, {"annotators_ids": [12, 5, 13, 15, 19, 4, 6, 14, 21, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "James DeGale faces Marco Antonio Periban at Liverpool's Echo Arena.\nGeorge Groves is preparing for the World Title fight.\nDeGale believes Groves has always been in his shadow.\nDeGale said he had never been friends with Groves.\nBoth fighters have benefited from their rivalry.\nGroves and DeGale are on the undercard to Tony Bellew's fight with Nathan Cleverly.\nHe should be grateful to me, 100 per cent.

But this summer\u2019s revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide.\u2019\n\nThe rare show of unity by usually fierce competitors is seen as a reflection of the damage in public confidence inflicted by leaks from the former NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower Snowden.\n\nEarlier this year he revealed how U.S. and British spy agencies were able to harvest huge amounts of data - including emails and search history - on millions of people by tapping into internet servers.\n\nIn the open letter to President Barack Obama and Congress, the company chiefs said states had trampled on constitutional rights with the wholesale trawling of citizens' internet information.\n\nThey demanded better oversight of government surveillance operations and new legal limits on how states can obtain sensitive, private information.\n\nIt read: 'The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual - rights that are enshrined in our Constitution. This undermines the freedoms we all cherish.

Should citizens trust them after all they have done against freedom?'\n\nSome twitter users wondered if profit not concerns over user privacy had motivated this open letter.\n\nGovernments are now facing a groundswell of opinion calling for reforms and limits to surveillance.\n\nTrevor Timm, an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the New York Times the strength of public outrage over government prying into their private data was now too big an issue to ignore for the internet companies.\n\nHe said: 'It\u2019s now in their business and economic interest to protect their users\u2019 privacy and to aggressively push for changes.\n\n'The N.S.A. mass-surveillance programs exist for a simple reason: cooperation with the tech and telecom companies. If the tech companies no longer want to cooperate, they have a lot of leverage to force significant reform.'\n\nNick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch a group which campaigns for civil liberties, said: 'There can be no doubt that the surveillance laws of Britain, the U.S. or countless other countries around the world are not fit for an internet age. Britain\u2019s own laws were written before many of these companies even existed.\n\n'Governments should not need to be told by private businesses that it is wrong to collect data on every citizen, through secret processes subject to little or no oversight.\n\n'Sadly that is the position we find ourselves in. This statement of principles, by some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, is a watershed moment and one that cannot go ignored in any country that regards itself as a democracy.\n\n'These businesses represent trillions of dollars of global revenue, highlighting the significant risk to the digital economy of those nations who do not take concerns about web surveillance seriously.'\n\nLast month, former U.S. intelligence contractor Snowden, 30, who fled to Russia where he is fighting extradition to the US on espionage charges, also called for surveillance program reforms.\n\nIn a letter published in Der Spiegel, he wrote: 'The world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and, at times, criminal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls.\n\n'While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders - at least according to the documents that are currently public - we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook: 'Reports about government surveillance have shown there is a real need for greater disclosure and new limits on how governments collect information. The U.S. Government should take this opportunity to lead this reform effort and make things right.'\n\nLarry Page, CEO, Google: 'The security of users' data is critical, which is why we've invested so much in encryption and fight for transparency around government requests for information. This is undermined by the apparent wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent oversight, by many governments around the world. It's time for reform and we urge the U.S. government to lead the way.'\n\nErika Rottenberg, General Counsel, LinkedIn: 'These principles embody Linkedin's fundamental commitment to transparency and ensuring appropriate government practices that are respectful of our members' expectations.'\n\nBrad Smith, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, Legal and Corporate Affairs, Microsoft: 'People won't use technology they don't trust. Governments have put this trust at risk, and governments need to help restore it.'\n\nDick Costolo, CEO, Twitter: 'Twitter is committed to defending and protecting the voice of our users. Unchecked, undisclosed government surveillance inhibits the free flow of information and restricts their voice. The principles we advance today would reform the current system to appropriately balance the needs of security and privacy while safeguarding the essential human right of free expression.'\n\nMarissa Mayer, CEO, Yahoo: 'Protecting the privacy of our users is incredibly important to Yahoo. Recent revelations about government surveillance activities have shaken the trust of our users, and it is time for the United States government to act to restore the confidence of citizens around the world.

If we vote to leave by one vote there is no going back. We will have bought a one-way ticket.\u2019\n\nHis warning seemed prescient last night as Downing Street was shaken by an ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph which put Yes on 54 per cent and No on 46 \u2013 though polling experts warned that the small survey size of 700 meant that it was vulnerable to a \u2018sampling error\u2019.\n\nAn Opinium poll for The Observer put No on 53 and Yes on 47.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Cameron said the vote was \u2018going down to the wire\u2019 and he hoped a final lovebombing from around the UK could persuade the undecideds to vote No.\n\nDescribing the contest as \u2018nerve-racking\u2019, he said: \u2018There are lots of things [people could do] whether it is using social media, tweeting and blogging your support for the UK; whether it is phoning a friend, talking to relations or work colleagues who live in Scotland and have a vote.\n\nHe wants families across England, Wales and Northern Ireland to put the Saltire in their windows\n\n\u2018Or whether it is more visual demonstrations \u2013 hoisting the Saltire over buildings, putting a flag in your window \u2013 there are any number of things people should do.\u2019\n\nHowever, as Mr Cameron was urging support for the union, a Mail On Sunday poll of voters south of the border was pointing to a growing backlash against the idea of granting extra powers to the Scots to persuade them to vote No.\n\nThe \u2018devo-max\u2019 cross-party deal, including scope for Scotland to set its own taxes, was hastily brokered by Gordon Brown last week after a poll put the Yes camp ahead. The new poll found that 43 per cent of English and Welsh think the move was a \u2018panic measure\u2019, while 61 per cent object to the fact that Scotland already receives the highest level of per-head public spending in the UK. Just 12 per cent think that Westminster should bail out an independent Scotland if it runs into financial trouble.\n\nThe knife-edge final days of the campaign have contributed to party turmoil for both Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband. One senior Tory MP confided to this newspaper that a \u2018clear majority\u2019 of Conservative MPs expected Mr Cameron to resign if the Scots vote for separation, and that his leadership could still be in trouble if the pro-union camp prevails on Thursday.\n\nThe MP, who holds an executive position on the party\u2019s powerful backbench 1922 Committee, said the rushed agreement to give the Scots greater devolution even if they voted to stay had annoyed rank and file MPs.\n\nHe said: \u2018More than 50 per cent of the Parliamentary party think the PM should go if he loses. But there is also an iceberg contingent who will be restless if we win, because we have promised too much \u2013 and let Gordon Brown lead the way.\u2019 He explained: \u2018A few MPs are very visibly complaining, but an awful lot more are grumbling out of sight.\u2019\n\nMr Miliband is facing internal ructions over Mr Brown\u2019s promise of enhanced devolution powers, with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls complaining during a tumultuous Shadow Cabinet meeting that he was \u2018out of the loop\u2019 on the offer \u2013 and warned it could prevent a future Labour Government from ever passing a Westminster Budget if Scottish MPs were barred from voting.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday poll highlights how much is at stake for the Labour leader. Survation found that across the UK, Labour\u2019s support is running at 35 per cent \u2013 a lead of four per cent over the Conservatives \u2013 enough to give Mr Milband a Commons majority of 44 if a General Election was held tomorrow.\n\nIf Scotland was excluded, Labour would be one point ahead, on 34 per cent, and Mr Miliband\u2019s majority would be slashed to just nine seats.\n\nDuring his interview, Mr Cameron insisted that the devo max plan in the aftermath of a No vote would be the final \u2018resting place\u2019 of devolution, and it would put an end to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe PM said: \u2018The UK is not indifferent, you hear lots of concerns about what it means for them, what it means for our standing, what the consequences would be. More than anything else from the rest of the UK you get arguments of passion rather than arguments about detail, which I hope shows everybody knows how much we care about the UK.\n\n'Scratch an Englishman and you don\u2019t have to go very deep until you find an absolute passionate Briton and someone who believes in the UK.\u2019\n\nThe Mail on Sunday poll also found that the referendum campaign has stimulated support for an English Parliament, with 47 per cent backing the measure and just nine per cent opposed.\n\nIt also showed strong support for a guarded border between England and Scotland if Mr Salmond signed up to the Schengen agreement, the EU\u2019s open-borders programme.\n\nThe Prime Minister will try to push home the No camp\u2019s advantage tomorrow with a major speech in which he is expected to pay tribute to Scotland as \u2018a proud, strong, successful nation\u2019 and hail \u2018the patriotic vision of a strong Scottish nation allied to the rest of the UK.\u2019\n\nResponding to the eight-point poll lead for the No camp, Mr Salmond said: \u2018I think it is wrong because I think there is huge movement \u2013 and the movement is towards Yes.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had over the last week panic, heeby-jeebies from Downing Street. The Yes campaign is going to win this campaign, and win it well.\u2019\n\nBalls: Brown\u2019s transfer of tax-raising powers would be a nightmare\n\nTaxing question: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls\n\nEd Balls has raised fears that handing massive new tax-raising powers to Scotland \u2013 as suggested by Gordon Brown \u2013 could mean big trouble for a future Labour government.\n\nThe Shadow Chancellor privately warned that Scottish Labour MPs might have to be banned from voting on budgets for England and Wales if Edinburgh gained control of income tax North of the border.And that could leave a Labour government at Westminster unable to pass finance legislation for the rest of the UK.\n\nMr Balls\u2019s concerns came amid predictions that Labour leader Ed Miliband will be \u2018fatally wounded\u2019 if Labour supporters in Scotland vote \u2018yes\u2019 on Thursday.\n\nA rapid timetable to hand Scotland sweeping new powers over income tax rates and finance in the event of a \u2018no\u2019 vote was unveiled by ex-Prime Minister Mr Brown last week in a surprise bid to reduce the likelihood of an independent Scotland.\n\nBut at a behind-closed-doors meeting of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet held the following day, Mr Balls warned of grave implications for an incoming Labour government if Mr Brown\u2019s plan went ahead.

But what of the girl in the tracksuit and grubby trainers? She would have looked more at home begging for change.\n\nIt was only when her companion was refused entry to the club, sparking an unseemly argument with door staff, that the penny dropped. This was no beggar; it was Kate Rothschild, mother-of-three and heiress to one of the world\u2019s most illustrious \u2014 and notorious \u2014 banking dynasties, with her rapper boyfriend, the extravagantly monikered Jay Electronica.\n\n\u2018To be quite frank I was shocked when I saw the pictures,\u2019 a long-standing family friend of the Rothschilds told me this week. \u2018One tries not to jump to conclusions, but when she goes out looking like that it is terribly worrying.\n\nDishevelled: Kate Rothschild with Jay Electronica last week\n\n\u2018The past 18 months have been particularly difficult for Kate. Everyone had been hoping that things would settle down, but she is increasingly out of reach. Fundamentally, she is a wonderful girl with a sensible head on her shoulders. She\u2019s also a great mum. But there is a wild, creative side which has a tendency to give everyone around her sleepless nights.\n\n\u2018From what I hear of the events the other day, they made quite a spectacle of themselves. What was she thinking?\u2019\n\nIndeed, Kate Rothschild\u2019s life has undergone a total transformation since 2005, when she was happy to describe herself as a housewife. Now she is a rock chick, hanging out with rappers.\n\nIt is certainly hard to believe that \nTuesday\u2019s apparition is the stunning girl who lit up the gossip columns a\n decade ago in the society wedding of the year.\n\nThe marriage of of Ben Goldsmith and Kate Rothschild ended in divorce in April 2013. Kate, then 21, was a vision of understated beauty as she wed Ben bringing together two of Britain's most fabulously wealthy dynasties\n\nKate, then 21, was a vision of understated beauty with flowers in her hair as she wed Ben Goldsmith, bringing together two of Britain\u2019s most fabulously wealthy dynasties. He was worth \u00a3300\u2009million; his bride a comparatively paltry \u00a318\u2009million.\n\nNow, her marriage destroyed, she spends her life trying to control a wannabe rapper. As Jay\u2019s manager, Kate, 31, has had to fit in with him \u2014 swapping designer dresses and jolly lunches for tracksuits and snatched cigarettes outside recording studios.\n\nMeanwhile, Jay, who has a daughter by a previous relationship and a penchant for marijuana and Jack Daniels, has introduced her to life a world away from her comfortable upbringing.\n\nWhen they go out partying, which is often, Jay likes to make an impression. His reputation is as a man who doesn\u2019t care who he offends \u2014 a trait that many blame for his failure thus far to turn talent into record sales.\n\nA smitten Kate, however, feels he can do no wrong. Witness the events of last week, when Jay, 37, (real name Timothy Elpadaro Thedford) demonstrated that while you can take the rapper out of the deprived housing projects of New Orleans, a questionable legacy remains.\n\nKate's marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after Ben uncovered her year-long affair with Jay after reading texts between the two\n\n\u2018He got into a massive argument with the bouncers because they wouldn\u2019t let him into the club,\u2019 says a witness to the fracas, which ended with the couple being admitted. Then, when they left, Jay was clearly the worse for wear because he started trying to open car doors, saying he was going to drive them home. Kate had to drag him away.\n\n\u2018Then he got into another argument \u2014 I think it was something to do with the ridiculous shorts and knee-high socks he was wearing \u2014 and Kate just leaned against a car, looking fed up.\n\n\u2018Eventually, they headed off home, but not with any dignity.\u2019\n\nBen Goldnsmith was so angry when he uncovered Kate's affair that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a child's toy at her\n\nDignity, sadly, has been in short supply\n since Kate\u2019s marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after Ben \nuncovered her year-long affair with Jay after reading texts between the \ntwo. He was so angry that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a\n child\u2019s toy at her.\n\nCue the police being summoned and a hugely unedifying public spat on Twitter, which culminated in divorce. Since then, Kate\u2019s life has changed almost beyond recognition. Always interested in the performing arts, she had been dabbling in the music industry and had set up her own business, Roundtable Records, for whom Jay was a star client, before the marriage broke down.\n\nShe has now swapped life within the London society bubble for a more chaotic existence with Jay. A number of society invitations have been discreetly withdrawn, not least because many of her and Ben\u2019s mutual friends were unimpressed by the public manner of their split.\n\n\u2018Kate leads a dual life,\u2019 adds the family friend. \u2018She is a fantastic mother, utterly dedicated to her three children, but when not on mummy duty she and Jay have a very different lifestyle.\n\n\u2018When I met him I found him perfectly charming. In a curious way, he\u2019s not at all dissimilar to Russell Brand because he is very passionate and articulate in an unconventional manner.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a peacock, but a very masculine peacock. Whereas Ben is socially confident and comfortable dealing with huge financial deals, he wouldn\u2019t be able to change a tyre. Jay could strip down the entire engine and put it back together. I think Kate finds that exciting. There is a passion in this relationship which was sadly lacking with Ben, for all that they were best friends.\u2019\n\nLike Brand \u2014 currently in a relationship with Kate\u2019s erstwhile sister-in-law, Jemima Khan \u2014 Jay is not your typical \u2018bit of rough\u2019.\n\nHis home, secured with the assistance of his ever-attentive manager, Kate, is a fifth-floor apartment in Belgravia. The few who have been invited in speak of a minimalist space with record decks, ashtrays (he and Kate are unreconstructed smokers) and bookshelves lined with weighty tomes including Sartre\u2019s Being And Nothingness and The Communist Manifesto.\n\nKate shares Jay's social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world\n\nJay nips around London on a motor scooter and spends the evenings at gigs with his girlfriend. Kate, who lives with her three children in a \u00a320\u2009million mansion in nearby Kensington, likes nothing more than to drop round to Jay\u2019s at the end of the day and cook dinner.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not like they\u2019re jetting around the world and he\u2019s hanging on her coat tails,\u2019 adds the friend. \u2018They\u2019re living quite a basic existence and he\u2019s very old-fashioned \u2014 when they go out, he pays his way.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s his combination of incredible talent and unassuming manner which appeals to Kate. She\u2019s a thoroughly nice girl who just wants to be normal. She loves urban music, and she\u2019d far rather go to Nando\u2019s than sit in a VIP suite sipping Bollinger and chatting to chinless wonders.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re both square pegs in round holes. Perhaps that\u2019s what has kept them together through everything.\u2019\n\nCertainly, they have weathered more storms than anyone expected. Last year, rumours abounded of an impending split when Jay was said to be spending time chatting up Cara Delevingne and her fellow models. But harmony returned. Today, Kate is happily divorced, combining motherhood with her new life. Family time is, in the words of a well-heeled contemporary, \u2018a life of Batman costumes, cupcakes and play-dates\u2019.\n\nThose who have observed her at close quarters say she is following her heart. Kate is understood to believe that were it not for her illustrious surname, she would have followed a different path. She shares Jay\u2019s social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world.\n\nIn America, many influential figures still have high hopes for him. Beyonce\u2019s husband Jay Z, the billionaire overlord of rap, has signed him up. Yet for all his undoubted talent, he has yet to produce the goods.\n\nHis debut album has been so long awaited it has become an industry joke. Occasionally, he gets drunk and takes to Twitter railing against his critics.\n\nHis reputation as a womaniser is enhanced by the fact he has a daughter with Erykah Badu, the Grammy award-winning singer. Sadly, he has never seen much of the little girl, who lives in America.Kate\u2019s faith in Jay seems unshakeable, but her music business is still to take off. According to her company accounts, Roundtable Records had stocks of \u00a31,885 and cash of \u00a3761, but owes Kate \u00a3365,606.\n\nLooking on the bright side, her relationship with her ex-husband has improved markedly as they share custody and strive to do their best for the children.\n\nWhile Ben, 33, remains hurt by her behaviour, he, too, has moved on and lives near to the family home with his new partner, Jemima Jones, 26, a lingerie model now working as a film producer. It is a conventional life, but he is happy.\n\nWhether the same can be said of Kate is questionable."}, {"annotators_ids": [4, 13, 19, 23, 5, 6, 12, 14, 15, 21], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "England have unveiled their new kit for first time against New Zealand.\nThe red rose will be worn for first time against Samoa on November 22.\nEngland have unveiled their new Canterbury kit.\nJulian Savea and New Zealand will be the first opponents for England in their new home shirt.\nEngland second row and Canterbury ambassador Geoff Parling is also impressed by the design.\nHe said: 'There is something special about wearing the English rose on your chest'.\nWhether you 're a player about to step on the pitch at Twickenham or a fan cheering the team on from the touch line'.", "text": "England have unveiled their new kit ahead of the autumn internationals - with the home design to be worn for the first time when Stuart Lancaster's men host the All Blacks on November 8.\n\nThe red rose has been moved to the centre of the shirts for the first time ever, directly above the title sponsor O2, and the 'Test' jersey is available for a hefty \u00a390.

A senior aide admitted: \u2018I\u2019m not aware that he goes every week.\u2019\n\nWhile William is not alone in failing to attend \u2013 barely 8 per cent of those who go to church regularly are men of a similar age \u2013 his stance is in strong contrast to other members of the Royal Family.\n\nThe Queen is a devout Christian with a deep sense of religious duty, who attends Church on a weekly basis\n\nThe Queen is a devout Christian with a deep sense of religious duty, who attends Church on a weekly basis.\n\nAnd for all his much-publicised interest in other faiths, Prince Charles is also a regular churchgoer.

But in the week ahead, we shall concentrate on the 40th anniversary of his most extraordinary achievement.\n\n\u2018The Rumble in the Jungle\u2019 sounds like one of those promotional slogans which emerge from a three-bottle lunch. Yet somehow it captured the swaggering audacity of the project which saw the two most celebrated athletes on the planet fight for the richest prize in sport in the small hours of a Kinshasa morning.\n\nMuhammad Ali looks on after knocking down George Foreman in the so-called Rumble in the Jungle\n\nOctober 30, 1974: Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman.\n\nThe heavyweight title was at stake, and the world was captivated.\n\nThe fight was made possible by the President of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, a deeply corrupt human rights abuser, who systematically exploited the nation formerly known as the Congo for more than 30 years. Mobutu paid more than $10million to promote his own image. It was then an unimaginable sum, far more than fighters had ever commanded. But then, he was hiring the very best.\n\nAli was 32 years old and was attempting to regain the title he had lost to Ken Norton more than a year earlier.\n\nAlthough many shared his own opinion that he was the greatest \u2018of ahhhhhl tahm!\u2019, they also suspected that he was past his peak, that after 46 fights his talents were eroding.\n\nAli was brought to Zaire for the fight by the infamous President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko\n\nAli trains in front of a captive audience in\u00a0Kinshasa before a cut to Foreman's eye delayed the fight\n\nAbove and beyond all this lay a widespread conviction that the 25-year-old Foreman was genuinely invincible, a monster, one of the most terrifying punchers the sport had known. He had won the title with a murderous dismantling of Joe Frazier, and he saw Ali as his lucrative victim.\n\n\u2018My opponents don\u2019t worry about losing,\u2019 he said. \u2018They worry about getting hurt.\u2019 It was as near as this malevolent, taciturn presence ever came to humour.\n\nBy dazzling contrast, Ali was a force of nature; bright, funny, endlessly personable and dauntingly handsome.\n\nSomebody once wrote of a fabled heavyweight: \u2018Joe Louis was a newspaperman\u2019s champion. He always finished in time for the first edition, so the guys could get to the bar before closing.\u2019\n\nAli will forever be remembered as the greatest heavyweight boxer in history, but the sport took its toll\n\nAli took a lot of punishment by methodically drawing Foreman in to waste the younger fighter's energy\n\n60,000 roaring fans packed Kinshasa\u2019s outdoor Stade du 20 Mai for the fight.\n\n32 -year-old Ali was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds. It is said that in the dressing room, Foreman and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill Ali.\n\n450 locations in the United States and Canada \u2014 and in some cinemas in the United Kingdom \u2014 screened the fight on closed-circuit television.\n\n100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight, which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in Zaire to accommodate audiences in the US.\n\n10 million dollars was split between the two \u2014 $5m each \u2014 paid for by President Mobutu.\n\n45 Foreman first quit in 1977 and returned in the early Nineties \u2014 winning the world title again at 45, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history.\n\nPerhaps so. But when Ali started to paint his word-pictures, he made the bar seem a poor alternative. Before the Foreman fight, he ran through his repertoire.\n\nHe was contemptuous: \u2018Foreman\u2019s a big old bully from Texas who used to beat up people on the streets.\u2019\n\nHe was dismissive: \u2018Foreman hits hard, sure. But hitting power don\u2019t mean nothing if you can\u2019t find nothing to hit.\u2019\n\nHe spouted yards of his terrible poetry: \u2018You think the world was shocked when Nixon resigned?/Wait till I whup George Foreman\u2019s behind.\u2019 And, right across the world, the public lapped it up.\n\nThere was a false start when a sparring partner\u2019s elbow cut Foreman\u2019s eye and both fighters were required to remain in Zaire for a month while Foreman recovered.\n\nAli spent much of the time storming around town and leading the locals in chants of \u2018Ali, bomaye!\u2019 (Ali, kill him!).\n\nFinally, on October 30, 1974, in the Stade du 20 Mai, before 60,000 people, a bell sounded and a fight began.\n\nAli had the locals in Zaire chanting 'Ali, bomaye', which translated means 'Ali, kill him!'\n\nAli begins returning the heavyweight champion of the world's blows with interest\n\nThe legend has grown, these past 40 years, that Ali offered himself as a target, that he simply lay on the ropes and allowed Foreman to punch himself out.\n\nThe promotional poster for the Rumble in the Jungle\n\nWell, up to a point. Watching the fight through once again this week, it could be seen that for calculated spells, Ali encouraged Foreman to throw those scything punches, most of which were deflected by arms and gloves. But time and again he would cut loose from the ropes with bewildering combinations to the head.\n\nForeman grew increasingly confused, unbearably weary. And all the time, Ali talked to him: \u2018You was sp\u2019osed to be bad, George! Show me something! That all you got, sucker? An\u2019 you gettin\u2019 tired, George. Ain\u2019t no place to get tired ...\u2019\u00a0And then, in the dying seconds of round eight, Ali found the energy and strength to throw the conclusive combination, and Foreman simply crumpled, exhausted, to the floor.\n\nI recall the London cinema erupting in joy and relief as the count finished and the aisles were awash with dancing, jostling figures.\n\nAli had that effect; neutrality was not an option. I remember walking out into the Leicester Square dawn, and thinking I should never see anything quite like that again. And I never did.\n\nHe would have a third fight with Frazier, a vicious battle in which both men inflicted enduring mental and physical damage.\n\nThen, as his resistance began to dissolve, every contest became an ordeal.\n\nForeman puts up his guard as Ali surges forward in what has been described as 'The Match of the Century'\n\nReferee Zack Clayton counts out foreman after Ali puts him on the canvass in the 8th round\n\nOn October 2, 1980, in a casino car park in Las Vegas, I squirmed at ringside as Ali, old beyond his 38 years, was cruelly punished by Larry Holmes.\n\nHe took punch after pounding punch to his unprotected head, but his perverse pride would not allow him to fall. So he stood and accepted his punishment, and the odious leeches who had taken his money and bathed in his glory simply shrugged and moved on.\n\nThe illness which would ultimately devour him took hold. The speech grew slower and thicker, the reactions ponderous, the decline precipitous.\n\nAs his condition became more distressing, it provoked serious moral questions about our readiness to condone such licensed barbarity. After all, if the very best of them could suffer such an excruciating fate, how can boxing hope to protect those who have only their courage to commend them? For many of us, the answer was all too obvious.\n\nAli staged three fights with the legendary Joe Frazier, which left both men physically and mentally damaged\n\nAli's brash style changed the way that sportsmen behaved, although few have backed their arrogance with genius\n\nAli left a tangled legacy. Effectively, he legitimised boasting and strident self-praise. Before Ali, sporting modesty was mandatory; you were diffident in victory, gracious in defeat.\n\nAfter Ali, across all our major sports, the old rules fell into disuse.\n\nWe now see an ordinary footballer celebrate a goal, or a journeyman cricketer a wicket, and all too easily we summon up a vision of a brash young man from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nBut the fact that routinely escapes the capering imposters is that the young man happened to be a genius. For once, it is not too inflated a term to describe what he did and how he did it.\n\nIn this anniversary week, as Ali\u2019s condition grows increasingly hazardous, I shall recall the words of George Foreman, when he made a visit to London two or three years ago.\n\nForeman had escaped the fate which befell Ali.

He co-starred in NBC's \"I Spy,\" becoming the first African-American male to star in a prime-time network drama -- and won three Emmys doing it.\n\nIn 1984, two decades later, Cosby made another pioneering TV achievement, reviving the then-dormant sitcom form by starring as the patriarch of a loving family called the Huxtables. The Cosby Show soon was TV's No. 1 show, and helped make NBC television's No. 1 network -- all while blasting another programming myth: That white viewers wouldn't embrace an all-black TV show.\n\nNow, 30 years after doctor and dad Cliff Huxtable, and almost 50 years after tennis trainer and secret agent Alexander Scott, NBC is returning to the Bill Cosby well one more time -- and hoping his stardom, fan base and legacy can bring some much-needed magic to broadcast television in the 21st century.\n\nThe Deadline Hollywood website has reported that NBC and Cosby, partnered with producer Tom Werner (part owner of the company that produced \"The Cosby Show\"), have reached an agreement to produce a family sitcom starring Cosby.\n\nThe question is, can lightning strike thrice? Can Cosby make TV history yet again? And is it even fair to expect or ask him to?\n\nRemember, first of all, that not every Bill Cosby TV series has been a guaranteed hit. After \"I Spy,\" Cosby scored big in the children's television arena, with the animated \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" and his playful appearances on \"The Electric Company\" and \"Sesame Street.\" But his prime-time series didn't always score as successes.\n\nHis first NBC series after \"I Spy,\" the 1969 sitcom \"The Bill Cosby Show,\" showcased him as a high-school coach and phys ed teacher. It was a very smart series, and positioned Cosby's Chet Kincaid in a strong position of authority, but it didn't catch on.\n\nHis next series -- for CBS this time -- came in 1972: a weekly variety series called \"The New Bill Cosby Show.\" Its key ingredients, in addition to Cosby's weekly comic monologues, included dancer-actress Lola Falana, pretend drunk Foster Brooks, and bandleader Quincy Jones. But this show, in an era when variety shows were as ubiquitous as reality shows are today, was gone after one season.\n\n1976's \"Cos,\" for ABC, was a variety show aimed at youngsters. It lasted two months. Then came \"The Cosby Show,\" eight seasons of which singlehandedly moved TV from the topical and raw comedy of Norman Lear's sitcoms to an era in which television parents regained control, and family civility returned.\n\nAfter \"The Cosby Show\" were more Cosby series, ones that never captured the same zeitgeist: NBC's \"The Cosby Mysteries\" (1994-95), and CBS's \"Cosby\" sitcom (1996-2000, re-teaming him with \"Cosby Show\" TV spouse Phylicia Rashad), and an \"Art Linkletter's House Party\" sequel of sorts: CBS's \"Kids Say the Darndest Things\" (1998-2000), with Cosby interviewing children.\n\nIn other words, over his TV career, Bill Cosby has hit as many singles and doubles as home runs. At 76, does Cosby have another long-ball miracle in him?\n\nMy bet is that he can, indeed, do it again -- provided he swings for the fences, and that NBC does nothing to impede Cosby from following his instincts and doing precisely what he wants.\n\nThe major warning flag, on NBC right now, is \"The Michael J. Fox Show,\" which has returned another '80s NBC sitcom icon to television -- but not successfully, because the network seemed to think that merely signing Fox and bringing him back was enough. It isn't. You need the right role, the right writers and the right cast, and you have to put them all together at the right time.\n\nBut Cosby, like a comedy locust, seems amazingly designed to surface every two or three decades and capture the imagination. In the right vehicle, he can do it again.\n\nHis timing and his jokes were on full, hilarious display in last year's Comedy Central standup special, whose title may prove prophetic: \"Bill Cosby: Far from Finished.\" Can his humor still work today, when, as always, he avoids going \"blue\"? It certainly worked on Comedy Central. Blue, black -- Bill Cosby never has made color more of a priority than universality.\n\nIf I were given a vote in designing Cosby's 21st-century sitcom comeback vehicle, I'd craft it as a dual home life/workplace vehicle, like the classic \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\" At home, let Cosby be the family grandpa, holding court over a loving, lively, extended family.\n\nBut let him to go work beyond retirement age, too, as a tenured college professor or a veteran media pundit on a TV talk show. Either way, he'd get to vent about current events, forgotten history and anything else the real William H. Cosby Ph.D. would care to bring to the viewing public via prime-time TV.\n\nIncluding, of course, his observations on family and other parts of his still-funny monologues. More than 50 years after he released his first comedy album, Bill Cosby is a very funny fellow.

It is a chronic and debilitating condition that can cause sufferers to vomit up to 30 times a day.'\n\nHyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies.\n\nThe condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of \u2018pregnancy hormone\u2019 HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception.\n\nIt causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis.\n\nIt is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers.\n\nThe severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences.\n\nThey cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week.\n\nIt can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food.\n\nHyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat.\n\nHospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated.\n\nTreatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition.\n\nAn intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice.\n\nThe condition can also affect the baby\u2019s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight.

Light cashmere overcoats in pale grey or white, a single-breasted coat in dusky pink.\n\nThe trench in its most traditional form - beige, gabardine, belted - was entirely absent. \nInstead, Bailey said, he wanted to introduce the elements of the trench \nbut in a gentler way.\n\nThat \nmeant stripping out the lining, using softer fabrics, softer shapes, and more generous\n cuts that enveloped and cocooned the figure rather than necessarily cinching it.\n\nSorbet: Bailey plumped for a hugely pretty palette with sugary shades of pistachio, lemon, candyfloss and delicate almond dominating\n\nAlways soulful, haunting, epic. Playlist was: Benjamin Twine, by George Ezra. Man On The Moon by Jake Bugg. When We Were On Fire (The Mahogany Sessions) by James Bay. Budapest by George Ezra. Bailey does the hard work so we can download and discover them.\n\n'I wanted this idea of everything being much more soft, \nmuch more gentle,' he said after the show. 'I liked the idea of taking out all the linings, all \nbut the most essential part of the trench.\n\nI liked the idea of taking the traditional trench coat, the iconic \nBurberry trenchcoat but then reimagining it with these soft, fluid \nfabrics. So we used a lot of double-faced cashmeres, we used a lot of \nsilks, so that everything had a very natural flow.\n\n'Fabric is the\n DNA of our brand,' he added. 'Thomas Burberry, our founder, invented gabardine, and\n it's something care about greatly. We have a whole team of people and \nall they do is work through the innovation, craftsmanship and \nconstruction of fabric.\n\n'Everything was soft and feminine and had that sense of kind of wrapping yourself in things.\n\n'There was kind of tenderness, a vulnerability.'\n\nThe colour palette - those dusky pinks and greens, palest yellow, sugary soft hues, were borne of Bailey's love of the English rose - hence the thousands of petals that rained down on the catwalk during the finale.\n\n'I wanted the colours to be soft and gentle, like sugared flowers,' Bailey said.\n\n'We've\n been talking about this English rose and the breadth and depth of the \ncolours. We tried to distill that, so there's a powderiness to the \ncolours as well as them just being pastel.'\n\nTrench detail was borrowed and used elsewhere. A\n deep sage coat-dress had a scoop neck that echoed the traditional lapel\n of the trench, a mint-green filigree shirt-dress used trench detailing at the \nback and trench lapels; Cara D walked in a transparent trench cape dotted with dusky pink \nbeading.\n\nElegant: Jourdan Dunn walked the runway in a draped skirt and sheer mint blouse\n\nSweet: Pink once again proved a popular choice and looks set to be a huge hit next summer\n\nEmbellished: Cara D modelled a cape in clear plastic embellished with gems down the runway\n\nPals: Harry Styles, in leopard print Burberry shirt, watches friend and long-time Burberry model Cara Delevingne walk the runway in dusky rose lace\n\nThe\n mood was certainly gentler than previous seasons (especially given that\n last season PVC pencil skirts were the look of the season). It was, \nsaid Bailey, meant to be warm, soft and a little bit romantic.\n\n\u2018I\n wanted the show to be gentle, to feel enveloping,\u2019 he said afterwards. \n\u2018I wanted it to have a real crafted feeling, something that \nfelt you were really cocooned and protected. It was very feminine, \ngentle and soft. But there was a sassiness and a sexiness underneath, \nand I like that idea of strength and fragility.\u2019\n\nCara Delevingne walked, as did \nJourdan Dunn. It is, Bailey agreed, important to have those big names \nwalking. In truth though, Cara has been part of the Burberry gang long \nbefore she was the \u2018model of the moment'.\n\n'We\n have always loved Cara,\u2019 Bailey said fondly, as the lady herself leapt around backstage \nwearing a balaclava and giving out bearhugs. \u2018She\u2019s part of the Burberry\n family.\n\n'We have worked with Cara for many, many years,' he added.

The cream of London's style set - as well as heavy hitters from around the world - turned out to see the latest effort from Christopher Bailey at the Kensington Gardens show.\n\nAmong the biggest of the big names was US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who joined Topshop supremo Sir Phillip Green and socialite Olivia Palermo on the front row.\n\nCelebrities paying Bailey the compliment of wearing Burberry to the show included Sienna Miller, who wore a black felt dress from the A/W13 collection and One Direction singer Harry Styles who plumped for a daring \u00a3395 leopard print military shirt.\n\nDonna Air also turned out in Burberry, choosing a stylish crocodile pencil skirt and a soft nappa leather tank. She was joined by actress Gabriella Wilde, the half-sister of Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas, and 21-year-old model, Suki Waterhouse.\n\nRounding off the stellar front row was Alexa Chung, model Arizona Muse and flame-haired singer Paloma Faith who was resplendent in - of course - a chic Burberry skirt.\n\nFashion on the Burberry FROW: Paloma Faith,Sienna Miller, Harry Styles and Suki Waterhouse seemed to be enjoying themselves as they waited for the show to begin\n\nStylish: New York socialite Olivia Palermo was elegant in a black jacket and skirt while Anna Wintour was her usual fashionable self in delicate duck egg blue\n\nBurberry fans: Sienna Miller (above) has appeared in Burberry fashion campaigns while Harry Styles - who recently wore the much-loved heart-print shirt - chose a \u00a3395 animal print shirt\n\nGolden girl: It girl and erstwhile TV presenter Donna Air had a ringside seat at Burberry\n\nFeeling blue: Burberry girl and actress Gabriella Wilde\n\nBradley's girl: Model Suki Waterhouse looked thrilled as she enjoyed Burberry from the sidelines\n\nEnglish Rose: British model Cara Delevingne with classic sleek hair\n\nAn edgier version of the classic English rose was Christopher Kane's beauty vision at Burberry and lead stylist Neil Moodie was the man asked to provide it.\n\n'Christopher Bailey\u2019s inspiration for the collection is English Rose distressed,' explained the hair guru. 'This is why I decided to blow dry the hair in a classic sleek - but not poker straight - as would be expected of an English Rose. I then texturised and mattified the hair with Moroccanoil products to give it an edgy, distressed look.'\n\nMoodie began by preparing wet hair with a Moroccanoil treatment before adding the brand's Frizz Control to make sure hair stayed beautifully smooth. 'Next, I applied Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream before blow drying the hair to ensure the movement created by the blow dry held and to give it a more luxury finish,' explained Neil.\n\nLuckily for those who want to recreate the look, it's one that works with any hair type. 'For thick hair, I blowdried it with a natural centre parting,' adds Neil. 'For long hair, I created some movement by flicking the ends under in a natural way.'\n\nOnce the hair was dry, it was divided it into sections and finished with Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray and Moroccanoil Volumising Mousse to add texture and create a matte finish.'\n\nNeil added: 'Before the models went on to the catwalk, the hair was tucked into the coats, and few stray sections were released at the back and side.'\n\nBeauty was created by Wendy Rowe using Burberry and introducing the Spring/Summer colours and Burberry nails."}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 12, 15, 21, 23, 19, 4, 5, 6, 14], "scores": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], "summary": "Greg Gibbins, 28, and his friends were at a Hotel in Toukley, NSW.\nHe was seriously stabbed but later died in hospital on Monday.\nHis 25-year-old friend tried to help and found The injured player with serious stab wounds.\nGibbins is expected to undergo surgery.\nHe was treated at the scene by paramedics and later died from cardiac arrest.\nMr Gibbons was a late bloomer who had recently secured a place training in the NSW cup squad.\nHe was arrested after the stabbing and taken to A Police Station.", "text": "Grieving family and friends have taken to social media to pay tribute to a man after he was fatally stabbed with a knife during a violent brawl in the early hours of Easter Monday.\n\nGreg Gibbins and his friends were at The\u00a0Beachcomber Hotel in Toukley on the Central Coast, NSW on Sunday night before they headed to a nearby, late-night pizza shop.\n\nShortly after midnight, emergency services found Mr Gibbins and his 25-year-old friend with serious stab wounds at about 12.10am from an alleged random attack.\n\nThe 28-year-old Wyong Roos rugby league club player was treated at the scene by paramedics before he went into cardiac arrest but later died at Gosford Hospital.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nGreg Gibbins, 28, went into cardiac arrest after he was seriously stabbed but later died in hospital on Monday\n\nThe friend, who tried to help fatally injured Mr Gibbins but became 'victim number two', remains in a serious condition in hospital and is expected to undergo surgery.\n\nPictures from Mr Gibbins Facebook account paints a 'top bloke' who got along with everyone and loved travelling, partying and going to festivals and sporting events.\n\nMr Gibbins, who works as a car spray painter, has prompted an outpouring grief from family, friends, colleagues and rugby team mates on his Facebook account.\n\nOne friend posted on Facebook: 'RIP gibbo such a lovely friend , it's clear the amazing impact you made on everybody's life, rest easy xx'\n\nA rugby team mate wrote: 'Rest easy mate, was great to have played with and against you.

The chip, from the edge of the area, sails harmlessly wide but Torres' movement is impressive.\n\n6th minute: The former Chelsea forward has put himself about in the early stages but, unfortunately for him, he has been just a little bit over-eager.

The Spaniard throws his arm down in frustration. He then runs deep into his own half, challenges well and advances into the Real half before being tackled by Marcelo. Torres is not happy about the challenge, but the referee waves away his protests.\n\nTorres waits for the ball to drop before attempting to control it during the Copa del Rey last-16 tie\n\n28th minute: Again Torres is caught offside. He is returning from an offside position but cannot get back onside before Raul Garcia's header reaches him.\n\n30th minute: Torres is still putting himself about and he jumps to compete for the ball with Sami Khedira. A flailing arm sees him catch the German midfielder and he gives a foul away. Khedira responds in kind by pushing his arm intro Torres' face when the Spaniard tries to get round him 30 seconds later and the Real midfielder is cautioned as a result.\n\nThe Spanish striker skips over a challenge from Ramos as he breaks clear of the Real defence\n\n41st minute: James Rodriguez sends in a corner for Real and Torres expertly heads clear to avert any danger.\n\n42nd minute: Marcelo wins the ball off Torres who gives the Brazilian a small touch in the back. He falls to the floor and Torres is penalised. It's soft but it probably is a foul.

For others it is the first step on a road that will lead to adoption and a new life.\n\nWhile traditional adoption hotspots are becoming less attractive -- Russia has banned Americans from adopting children, and it can take years to navigate China's adoption bureaucracy -- Uganda is seen as a quick and easy alternative for prospective parents.\n\nOpinion: Russia's adoption ban harms kids\n\nIn Uganda, the adoption process can take just a few months to complete. The country is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, a treaty which provides a blueprint for safe international adoptions.\n\nMany of the children adopted from Uganda are given a better shot at life overseas - certainly in material terms -- but the speed and ease of the process has many observers worried.\n\nFreda Luzinda worked at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, for two years processing adoption visas. She is now the Uganda national director of the A Child's Voice, an NGO promoting child rights and welfare.\n\nShe says that many birth parents in Uganda don't fully understand what adoption actually means and that there is no word for 'adoption' in the local Luganda language.\n\n\"I can say that about 60% of the birth parents that I spoke to didn't understand adoption,\" said Luzinda.\n\nMany birth parents do not understand that adoption is permanent. They believe they may get their children back later. These misconceptions are part of the problem, but not the only problem.\n\nThe rise in Ugandan adoptions over the past few years has created a growing number of orphanages and adoption agencies to meet the demand.\n\n\"When I first started processing visas at the embassy... there were probably between seven and 10 orphanages that were putting children up for adoption. And the numbers grew, and they grew, and they grew. By the time I finished, and this was two years later, we had a count, and we were dealing with about 100 orphanages.\" said Luzinda.\n\nThe explosive growth of the adoption industry in Uganda has fueled fears that children are being exploited for profit and that the best interests of the child is not paramount.\n\n\"Orphan creation does happen a lot in Uganda, and this is done by adoption facilitators who will go and scout the slums, find vulnerable families and talk them into giving up their children,\" said Luzinda.\n\nIn the 12 years from 1999-2010 there were just 311 adoptions from Uganda to the U.S. In 2011 alone -- the last year for which State Department numbers are available -- 207 children were adopted to the U.S. from Uganda.\n\nBrothers Zach, age about 4 and Philip, about a year older, have found a loving family in the U.S. but their early life was typical of Uganda's estimated 2.4 million orphans.\n\nBoth boys were found abandoned in different places in Kampala, both were left in conspicuous places and both were found by police officers.\n\nNow Zach and Philip have a new life in the U.S., both are in school and having loving new parents.\n\nIn 2008, they were adopted by Lisa and Tague Harding of Minnesota through the Amani Baby Cottage, one of the respected, religiously-affiliated orphanages.\n\n\"There is always a tragedy at the beginning of a story that makes adoption a necessary step,\" said Lisa.\n\nAs their children grew up and left home, the Hardings saw an opportunity to provide a stable home for children who would otherwise grow up in poverty.\n\nInternet reveals secrets of 'closed' adoptions, report says\n\nThe Hardings became interested in international adoption after traveling to Uganda with a church group.\n\n\"I love that in our faith, adoption is part of the story -- that Baby Moses was adopted and there was Samuel in the Bible that was adopted and baby Jesus. Joseph was not his birth father.\" said Lisa.\n\nDanyne Randolph Bharj, director of the Amani Baby Cottage, understands the fears concerning the exploitation of children, but says that given the options for Ugandan children, in many cases adoption is the best solution.\n\n\"I don't think it's right to say the West is the way to save Uganda at all. I don't think that's the answer. But I think if there's people in the West that can give these children a family when no one else can, I do think it's more important,\" said Bharj.\n\nBut James Kabogoza, assistant commissioner of Children's Affairs for the Ugandan Government, feels that Ugandan children should stay in Uganda.\n\n\"It's not right what they are doing. I know for them they get something out of it, but it's also wrong to defraud parents and Ugandans of their children,\" he said.\n\nKabogoza's fear is that by leaving Uganda, many of these orphans will lose sight of their cultural identity.\n\nHe also believes that regardless of the circumstances, many of these children would be better off with their birth parents.\n\n\"That is the biggest thing that ever happens to a child. If the child remains with the family, they are able to grow up with them,\"said Kabogoza.\n\nHe added: \" know they feel what is done in America and what is proper in America is a better life.

I never made it to look like that. I just call it my barn. There are also apparently rumours that I had a dispute with the planning office - which is utter nonsense. I moved on because of a quarry.\n\n'They found Forest Marble - which is in high demand - near to my land. I knew there would be lots of lorries trundling in and out constantly so I decided to give it all up.\n\n'When I first sold up, I had dreams about it every night. A woman spends nine months carrying a child, but I spent 11 years on the barn. I felt lost without it.\n\n'Although it was a really difficult decision, know I made the right choice. I've moved on and have done other things.\n\nMr Stokes added that he had only been back to the building once since he left in 2000.\n\nInterior: The barn includes a place for Mr Stokes to sleep during lambing season, pictured left, and several examples of the artist's stained glass windows, right\n\nArtistic: This picture shows another window made by Mr Stokes.

It has such a magical feel about it.\u201d\n\n'This little hobbit house was amazingly hand built by Colin many years ago his treasured animals.''He built it all on his own, stone by stone and the stained glass windows were all hand painted.

The new poll found that 43 per cent of English and Welsh think the move was a \u2018panic measure\u2019, while 61 per cent object to the fact that Scotland already receives the highest level of per-head public spending in the UK. Just 12 per cent think that Westminster should bail out an independent Scotland if it runs into financial trouble.\n\nThe knife-edge final days of the campaign have contributed to party turmoil for both Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband. One senior Tory MP confided to this newspaper that a \u2018clear majority\u2019 of Conservative MPs expected Mr Cameron to resign if the Scots vote for separation, and that his leadership could still be in trouble if the pro-union camp prevails on Thursday.\n\nThe MP, who holds an executive position on the party\u2019s powerful backbench 1922 Committee, said the rushed agreement to give the Scots greater devolution even if they voted to stay had annoyed rank and file MPs.\n\nHe said: \u2018More than 50 per cent of the Parliamentary party think the PM should go if he loses. But there is also an iceberg contingent who will be restless if we win, because we have promised too much \u2013 and let Gordon Brown lead the way.\u2019 He explained: \u2018A few MPs are very visibly complaining, but an awful lot more are grumbling out of sight.\u2019\n\nMr Miliband is facing internal ructions over Mr Brown\u2019s promise of enhanced devolution powers, with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls complaining during a tumultuous Shadow Cabinet meeting that he was \u2018out of the loop\u2019 on the offer \u2013 and warned it could prevent a future Labour Government from ever passing a Westminster Budget if Scottish MPs were barred from voting.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday poll highlights how much is at stake for the Labour leader. Survation found that across the UK, Labour\u2019s support is running at 35 per cent \u2013 a lead of four per cent over the Conservatives \u2013 enough to give Mr Milband a Commons majority of 44 if a General Election was held tomorrow.\n\nIf Scotland was excluded, Labour would be one point ahead, on 34 per cent, and Mr Miliband\u2019s majority would be slashed to just nine seats.\n\nDuring his interview, Mr Cameron insisted that the devo max plan in the aftermath of a No vote would be the final \u2018resting place\u2019 of devolution, and it would put an end to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe PM said: \u2018The UK is not indifferent, you hear lots of concerns about what it means for them, what it means for our standing, what the consequences would be. More than anything else from the rest of the UK you get arguments of passion rather than arguments about detail, which I hope shows everybody knows how much we care about the UK.\n\n'Scratch an Englishman and you don\u2019t have to go very deep until you find an absolute passionate Briton and someone who believes in the UK.\u2019\n\nThe Mail on Sunday poll also found that the referendum campaign has stimulated support for an English Parliament, with 47 per cent backing the measure and just nine per cent opposed.\n\nIt also showed strong support for a guarded border between England and Scotland if Mr Salmond signed up to the Schengen agreement, the EU\u2019s open-borders programme.\n\nThe Prime Minister will try to push home the No camp\u2019s advantage tomorrow with a major speech in which he is expected to pay tribute to Scotland as \u2018a proud, strong, successful nation\u2019 and hail \u2018the patriotic vision of a strong Scottish nation allied to the rest of the UK.\u2019\n\nResponding to the eight-point poll lead for the No camp, Mr Salmond said: \u2018I think it is wrong because I think there is huge movement \u2013 and the movement is towards Yes.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had over the last week panic, heeby-jeebies from Downing Street.

Mr Balls said: \u2018If we give away the whole tax-raising power to the Scottish Parliament, how can Scottish Labour MPs then vote for a Labour Budget in England?\u2019\n\nCurrently, 40 of the 59 Scottish MPs are Labour, with pollsters predicting Mr Miliband will need a sizeable Scottish contingent at Westminster to form a government with a workable Commons majority after the General Election next May. A witness at the meeting said: \u2018It was clear what Balls was saying.\n\n\u2018He was wondering out loud how we would get Budgets passed at Westminster without Scottish Labour votes.

For others it is the first step on a road that will lead to adoption and a new life.\n\nWhile traditional adoption hotspots are becoming less attractive -- Russia has banned Americans from adopting children, and it can take years to navigate China's adoption bureaucracy -- Uganda is seen as a quick and easy alternative for prospective parents.\n\nOpinion: Russia's adoption ban harms kids\n\nIn Uganda, the adoption process can take just a few months to complete. The country is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, a treaty which provides a blueprint for safe international adoptions.\n\nMany of the children adopted from Uganda are given a better shot at life overseas - certainly in material terms -- but the speed and ease of the process has many observers worried.\n\nFreda Luzinda worked at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, for two years processing adoption visas. She is now the Uganda national director of the A Child's Voice, an NGO promoting child rights and welfare.\n\nShe says that many birth parents in Uganda don't fully understand what adoption actually means and that there is no word for 'adoption' in the local Luganda language.\n\n\"I can say that about 60% of the birth parents that I spoke to didn't understand adoption,\" said Luzinda.\n\nMany birth parents do not understand that adoption is permanent. They believe they may get their children back later. These misconceptions are part of the problem, but not the only problem.\n\nThe rise in Ugandan adoptions over the past few years has created a growing number of orphanages and adoption agencies to meet the demand.\n\n\"When I first started processing visas at the embassy... there were probably between seven and 10 orphanages that were putting children up for adoption. And the numbers grew, and they grew, and they grew. By the time I finished, and this was two years later, we had a count, and we were dealing with about 100 orphanages.\" said Luzinda.\n\nThe explosive growth of the adoption industry in Uganda has fueled fears that children are being exploited for profit and that the best interests of the child is not paramount.\n\n\"Orphan creation does happen a lot in Uganda, and this is done by adoption facilitators who will go and scout the slums, find vulnerable families and talk them into giving up their children,\" said Luzinda.\n\nIn the 12 years from 1999-2010 there were just 311 adoptions from Uganda to the U.S. In 2011 alone -- the last year for which State Department numbers are available -- 207 children were adopted to the U.S. from Uganda.\n\nBrothers Zach, age about 4 and Philip, about a year older, have found a loving family in the U.S. but their early life was typical of Uganda's estimated 2.4 million orphans.\n\nBoth boys were found abandoned in different places in Kampala, both were left in conspicuous places and both were found by police officers.\n\nNow Zach and Philip have a new life in the U.S., both are in school and having loving new parents.\n\nIn 2008, they were adopted by Lisa and Tague Harding of Minnesota through the Amani Baby Cottage, one of the respected, religiously-affiliated orphanages.\n\n\"There is always a tragedy at the beginning of a story that makes adoption a necessary step,\" said Lisa.\n\nAs their children grew up and left home, the Hardings saw an opportunity to provide a stable home for children who would otherwise grow up in poverty.\n\nInternet reveals secrets of 'closed' adoptions, report says\n\nThe Hardings became interested in international adoption after traveling to Uganda with a church group.\n\n\"I love that in our faith, adoption is part of the story -- that Baby Moses was adopted and there was Samuel in the Bible that was adopted and baby Jesus. Joseph was not his birth father.\" said Lisa.\n\nDanyne Randolph Bharj, director of the Amani Baby Cottage, understands the fears concerning the exploitation of children, but says that given the options for Ugandan children, in many cases adoption is the best solution.\n\n\"I don't think it's right to say the West is the way to save Uganda at all. I don't think that's the answer. But I think if there's people in the West that can give these children a family when no one else can, I do think it's more important,\" said Bharj.\n\nBut James Kabogoza, assistant commissioner of Children's Affairs for the Ugandan Government, feels that Ugandan children should stay in Uganda.\n\n\"It's not right what they are doing. I know for them they get something out of it, but it's also wrong to defraud parents and Ugandans of their children,\" he said.\n\nKabogoza's fear is that by leaving Uganda, many of these orphans will lose sight of their cultural identity.\n\nHe also believes that regardless of the circumstances, many of these children would be better off with their birth parents.\n\n\"That is the biggest thing that ever happens to a child. If the child remains with the family, they are able to grow up with them,\"said Kabogoza.\n\nHe added: \" know they feel what is done in America and what is proper in America is a better life. But you could provide that better life to the child here, within the family ... You can change the life of that child within the family here, if you support them.\"\n\nZach and Philip' adopted father, Tague Harding, understands that his sons will lose some of their cultural heritage by growing up in the United States, but he also sees the advantages.\n\n\"It's better that Ugandan orphans stay in Uganda as much as possible but perhaps by us bringing two boys home or other people bringing Ugandan children back internationally, we can raise awareness to say, there is a need.\"\n\nLisa Desai, Sarah Gross, Yasmeen Qureshi of Three Strands Media produced \"Adopting Africa\" for CNN.

However he is still yet to re-lace the gloves and it has been suggested that he might never do so again.\n\nBut 'The Hayemaker' is adamant he will box on, has already set his sights on American knock-out artist Wilder and thinks a world title showdown within just 18 months could be possible.\n\nHaye said: 'Yes you will see me back in the ring. I've been taking it easy of late as obviously I had a bad shoulder injury so I needed reconstructive surgery on it.\n\n'That's good now, I've got all the movement back and I'm banging harder than ever with that.

Deontay Wilder is a very good champion and if i start fighting regularly I am probably a year or 18 months away from being in a mandatory position to fight him.\n\n'I'm not stupid and I don't think I will just jump straight in there.

But Klitschko's next outing, a defence of his WBA, WBO and IBF belts against Bryant Jennings, will be at New York's iconic Madison Square Garden on April 25.\n\n'It makes a change,' Haye said. 'In America things are starting to shake up and I think he's realised by continuously fighting in Germany, only German people watch that.\n\n'Worldwide he doesn't do great business and I think he realises time's ticking and he doesn't have many fights left in him. For the next couple of years he wants to really finish his legacy with some really big fights.

They weren't getting paid. Out of the goodness of their hearts they came down to Fitzroy Lodge in Lambeth and trained a bunch of kids.\n\n'Even if you don't make a career out of it, there is so much badness out there on the streets on a daily basis.

Appeals court challengers said in a court filing.\n\n'Major economic decisions like these - indeed, any decisions granting tax credits - must be made unambiguously by Congress itself.'\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety.\n\n'It is pretty obvious what the congressional intent was here,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, which was for every qualified American to receive a subsidy 'regardless of whether it was state officials or federal officials running the marketplace.'\n\nPierce said the D.C. ruling is 'at odds with the goal of the law.'\n\n'We believe that this decision is incorrect, inconsistent with \nCongressional intent,' the Justice Department official said.\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act say the challengers to the law are failing to consider the words of the statute in its entirety\n\nAn appeals court filing by congressional and state legislative supporters of the Affordable Care Act, similarly argues that 'Congress did not provide that the tax credits would only be available to citizens whose states set up their own exchanges.'\n\nCongressional lawmakers and state legislators who are against the law hope that by limiting the subsidies to state exchanges, they can destabilize important aspects of the law, such as the individual mandate requiring most people to buy insurance.\n\nAndre \nDavis, a  Senior Circuit Court Judge serving on the Richmond court, explained the court's decision this way:\n\n'If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would\n be fine with a pizza from Domino's, and I then specify that I want ham \nand pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from \nDomino's with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a \nliteral construction of my lunch order.'\n\nDavis and his colleagues voted to uphold what the Obama administration says was the 'intent' of law - subsidies for all qualified Americans, regardless of whether they signed up for coverage through the state or federal exchanges.\n\n'Today\u2019s ruling highlights the ramifications of hastily passing legislation before fully knowing and understanding what it entails and how it will affect people,' House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers said in a statement after the D.C. decision was handed down.\n\n'For months, people all across this country have seen firsthand the flawed and ineffective implementation of Obamacare \u2013 in their skyrocketing premiums, lost coverage, limited access, and regulatory inefficiencies.\n\n'And today\u2019s decision is only further evidence of the legislation\u2019s failure,' the GOP leader said.'

Bush; A. Raymond Randolph, an appointee of Bush's father; and Harry Edwards, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, who dissented.\n\nA lower court had ruled that the law's text, structure, purpose, and legislative history make 'clear that Congress intended to make premium tax credits available on both state-run and federally-facilitated Exchanges.'\n\nBut the appeals court concluded the opposite - that the letter of the law 'unambiguously restricts' the law's subsidies to policies sold through exchanges established by the state.\n\n'An Exchange established by the federal government cannot possibly be \"an Exchange established by the State,\" ' Randolph wrote in a concurring opinion. 'To hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation.\n\n'Only further legislation could accomplish the expansion the government seeks.'\n\nIn a statement celebrating the D.C. court's decision, Sam Kazman, general counsel for the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, one of the organization's responsible for \nfunding the lawsuit said, 'The court\u2019s decision puts an end to the power grab that the IRS rule represented.\n\n'And more importantly it reaffirms the fact that we are a nation of laws enacted by Congress rather than rules issued by agenda-driven agencies,' Kazman added.\n\n'Despite all the political calls for the country to 'get with the program and support Obamacare,\" it\u2019s the Framers of the Constitution who have the last word.'"}, {"annotators_ids": [6, 12, 14, 19, 21, 4, 5, 13, 15, 23], "scores": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], "summary": "Farooq Sattar, a member of parliament, was on a plane at the airport when the attack took place.\nAnother TTP member claimed the Pakistani government has been \"abducting and killing innocent people,\" and explained why the airport was targeted.\nKarachi airport attackers were disguised as security workers", "text": "Seven bodies have been recovered near a cold storage facility at a Karachi airport Tuesday morning, more than a day after a deadly militant attack there left 29 others dead.\n\nThe seven cargo workers were found in rubble near the hall where a fire broke out during the attack, Sindh province Health Minister Dr. Saghir Ahmad said.

He said he was 100% sure there were no militants left in the airport.\n\nSeveral days ago, Pakistan's government had warned provincial officials of a possible \"high-profile attack on a sensitive or key installation,\" said Qaim Ali Shah, chief minister of Sindh province. But the warning, he said, did not mention the airport.\n\n'We felt like sitting ducks'\n\nFarooq Sattar, a member of parliament, was on a plane at the airport when the attack took place.\n\n\"My aircraft was on the tarmac ready to take off when suddenly, from what I understand, a message came to the pilot saying to get off the runway and return to the gate,\" Sattar said. \"I heard shots and saw smoke.\"\n\n\"Before the pilot could announce anything, I had text messages blowing up my phone saying 'Karachi airport under attack.'  We were in the aircraft for three hours, full of fuel. They locked the doors.\n\n\"The airport was poorly guarded. It was only due to some airport security personnel that the attack got thwarted and the militants didn't make it to our part of the airport. Passengers were extremely nervous. They started looking at me for answers.\"\n\n\"We felt like sitting ducks on the tarmac,\" he added.\n\nTwo crew members who were on their first ever flight \"freaked out,\" Sattar said.\n\nHistory of terror\n\nThe Pakistani Taliban, which is formally known as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, has long conducted an insurgency against the Pakistani government.\n\n\"Their primary target is the Pakistani state and its military,\" said Raza Rumi of the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank.\n\n\"It resents the fact that (Pakistan) has an alliance with the West, and it wants Sharia to be imposed in Pakistan.\"\n\nThe group claimed responsibility for a December 2009 suicide bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack killed seven U.S. citizens, including five CIA officers and a member of Jordanian intelligence.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department charged Mehsud in 2010 for his alleged involvement in the attack.\n\nMehsud took over from Baitullah Mehsud, a fellow clan member, in 2009 after the latter was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Four years later, Hakimullah Mehsud suffered the same fate.\n\nMore claims and threats\n\nAnother TTP member claimed the Pakistani government has been \"abducting and killing innocent people,\" and explained why the airport was targeted.\n\n\"We chose a location where there would be less civilian and more official casualties,\" TTP representative Shahidullah Shahid said.\n\nShahid warned the group will engage \"in a full-out war with the Pakistani state, starting on June 10.\"\n\nBut \"if even now the Pakistani government backs down,\" Shahid said, \"we are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue.\"\n\nKarachi airport attackers were disguised as security workers\n\nMore violence\n\nThe airport wasn't the only site of violence in Pakistan on Sunday.\n\nTwin suicide attacks near the border with Iran left 24 people dead, including four terrorists, authorities said. Qambar Dashti, commissioner of the Quetta Division, said two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a hotel where dozens of Shia pilgrims from Iran were staying.\n\nDashti said 14 out of 18 wounded pilgrims were in critical condition.\n\nExtremist Sunni militant group Jaish el-Islam, a splinter group of Lashkar e Jhangvi, claimed responsibility.\n\nOn Monday, while Karachi operated as usual, there was violence in other parts of the country.\n\nThree soldiers were killed and many others were wounded in a suspected suicide attack at a checkpoint in North Waziristan, military officials said.\n\nWhat's behind Karachi airport attack?"}, {"annotators_ids": [4, 5, 13, 6, 12, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23], "scores": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "Danielle Watson, now clean, says she 'loved' taking horse tranquiliser ketamine and mephedrone, commonly known as 'meow meow', at parties, and quickly fell into a pattern of taking 5g - 50 lines - of each drug every day.\nDanielle says she was a rebellious teenager but didn't realise the drugs were as dangerous as Class A substances such as cocaine and heroin - which she says she would never take - because mephedrone was still legal, and ketamine had been banned only the previous year.\nDeaths by party drugs such as ketamine and mephedrone have quadrupled in the last five years", "text": "A 23-year-old woman who binged on party drugs including ketamine and 'meow meow' during her teenage years - at one point snorting as many as 100 lines a day - has spoken out about how the substances left her body in tatters, and revealed she will now be having her bladder removed as a result of the damage inflicted upon it.\n\nDanielle Watson, now clean, says she 'loved' taking horse tranquiliser ketamine and mephedrone, commonly known as 'meow meow', at parties, and quickly fell into a pattern of taking 5g - 50 lines - of each drug every day.

Kevin Keegan was manager and he\u2019d invited my family \u2013 waiting for me in the stands \u2013 down to the dugout area to watch me perform.\n\nAfter the interview I introduced Jonas to my parents, shaking my dad warmly by the hand and giving my mam a kiss on either cheek. It was then that we realised her shoe was caught in the drain on the fringe of the pitch. Without further notice Jonas was down on all fours manoeuvring the shoe back and forth in a bid to free it. Thirty seconds and two more kisses later we were all on our way. He\u2019d even signed the matchday programmes of which he was the cover star.\n\nIn fact, I have never seen Jonas refuse an autograph or an interview.

Gutierrez, though, stayed and played a key role in the club regaining their top-flight status \u2013 there was also the long-awaited appearance of the Spiderman mask at St James\u2019 Park following a fine goal against Peterborough.

It is a chronic and debilitating condition that can cause sufferers to vomit up to 30 times a day.'\n\nHyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies.\n\nThe condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of \u2018pregnancy hormone\u2019 HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception.\n\nIt causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis.\n\nIt is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers.\n\nThe severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences.\n\nThey cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week.\n\nIt can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food.\n\nHyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat.\n\nHospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated.\n\nTreatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition.\n\nAn intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice.\n\nThe condition can also affect the baby\u2019s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight.

the same as a spec of dust - is enough to kill someone, due to its slowly-excreted alpha particles which affect the body's organs.\n\nAfter ingestion, Polonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract.\n\nSerious illness would not be expected for a month, due to the amount of time it takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures.\n\nAs the severity of the exposure develops in the body, victims usually lose hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed.\n\nThis later leads to severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, loss of fluids, and disturbance of electrolyte balance.\n\nThough it takes 5-6 weeks to seriously affect most, the symptoms of Polonium poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko (above), who fell ill the day after he was exposed.\n\nThe Russian died 23 days after being exposed, an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage.\n\nBochud said the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210.\n\n'But we have to do it quite fast because \npolonium is decaying, so if we wait too long, for sure, any possible \nproof will disappear,' he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIt emerged today that Palestinians are ready to accept a medical examination of Arafat's body if his family agrees, according to a Palestinian official.\n\nThe comments from Tawfiq Tirawi, who led a Palestinian probe into Arafat's death, came just hours after the Al-Jazeera investigation showed the Palestinian leader might have been poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium.\n\nThe official told AP: 'After the Al-Jazeera broadcast I met today with president (Mahmud) Abbas and recommended accepting an analysis of the body of the martyr president Arafat, and Abbas for his part agreed on the condition that the family... accepts.'\n\nPolonium was found to have caused the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, and he was assumed to have been deliberately poisoned.\n\nArafat's widow Suha said she would ask for Arafat's body - buried in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian self-rule authority - to be exhumed.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the documentary, aired on Al Jazeera's English and Arabic channels, she said: 'We have to go further and exhume Yasser Arafat's body to reveal the truth to all the Muslim and Arab world.'\n\nArafat led the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's fight against Israel from the 1960s but signed a peace agreement with the Jewish state in 1993 establishing Palestinian self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nHis mysterious death came four years into a Palestinian uprising, after years of talks with Israel failed to lead to a Palestinian state.\n\nFrench doctors who treated Arafat in his final days could not establish the cause of death.\n\nFrench officials refused to give details of his condition, citing privacy laws, fuelling a host of rumours and theories over the nature of his illness."}, {"annotators_ids": [13, 6, 15, 19, 4, 5, 12, 14, 21, 23], "scores": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], "summary": "A naked, malnourished four-year-old boy found inside an apartment in New Jersey with the body of his dead mother had resorted to eating from a bag of sugar, police said Wednesday.\nThe toddler\u2019s first request after being examined, police said, was a grilled cheese sandwich and a juice.\nHis mother, identified as Kiana Workman, 38, from Brooklyn, was discovered dead Tuesday on the floor of her bedroom after maintenance workers at the apartment complex in northern New Jersey reported a foul odor.\n\u2018It's overwhelming,\u2019 Zieser said.", "text": "A naked, malnourished four-year-old boy found inside an apartment in New Jersey with the body of his dead mother had resorted to eating from a bag of sugar, police said Wednesday.\n\nThe toddler\u2019s first request after being examined, police said, was a grilled cheese sandwich and a juice.\n\nHis mother, identified as Kiana Workman, 38, from Brooklyn, was discovered dead Tuesday on the floor of her bedroom after maintenance workers at the apartment complex in northern New Jersey reported a foul odor.\n\nHeartbreaking outcome: The decomposing body of 38-year-old Kiana Workman is being wheeled out of an apartment in Union, New Jersey, where she had remained for four days with her young son\n\nBecause the chain lock was on, police said, her son couldn't get out.\n\nOfficer Joseph Sauer said the boy was\nnaked but coherent and not crying when he kicked in the door and his \npartner lifted the youngster up by the arms and pulled him out of the \noverheated apartment.\n\n\u2018The only way to describe the little \nboy was it was like a scene from World War II, from a concentration \ncamp, he was that skinny.

The researchers measured supplement intake using questionnaires that relied on the memory of the participants, for instance.\n\nIn addition, the researchers don't know whether the women were taking supplements for a health problem. The increases in death risk might therefore be due to underlying health conditions rather than the supplements themselves, says Susan Fisher, Ph.D., a professor of community and preventive medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in Rochester, N.Y.\n\n\"People [often] go to the vitamin store because they feel something isn't right -- their memory is slipping, they don't have as much energy,\" says Fisher, who was not involved in the new study. \"These could be subconscious symptoms of a disease that is eventually going to take their life.\"\n\nHealth.com: Heart trouble? 30 herbal remedies to avoid\n\nThe use of dietary supplements has exploded in the United States in recent decades. According to the study, roughly half of all adults reported taking supplements in 2000.\n\nThe rates were even higher among the 38,772 women in Iowa who participated in the study. Sixty-three percent were taking at least one supplement when the study began, in 1986, but by 2004 that number had jumped to 85%. And more than one-quarter of those women reported taking four or more supplements on a regular basis.\n\nThe women were 62 years old at the beginning of the study, on average, and none had chronic health conditions (with the exception of diabetes and high blood pressure). Just over 40% of the women had died by the time the study ended in 2008.\n\nWomen who took calcium -- which is known to reduce the risk of bone fractures associated with aging -- were 9% less likely to die during the study than women who did not take it, but most of the other supplements were associated with an increased risk of death. Some supplements, including beta-carotene, vitamins A and C, and selenium, didn't appear to affect death risk either way.\n\nHealth.com: 11 foods for healthy bones\n\nHowever, the increases in death risk (or decrease, in the case of calcium) were extremely small and may not be clinically meaningful, says Mary L. Chavez, a professor of pharmacy practice at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Kingsville.\n\nSeveral factors besides supplement use may have shaped the results. Fisher points out, for instance, that the use of hormone therapy to treat the symptoms of menopause was nearly twice as common among supplement users as among nonusers. Some forms of hormone therapy have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and breast cancer.\n\nThe researchers did take hormone therapy into account in their analysis, along with several other potentially mitigating factors (including age, educational attainment, body mass index, diet, and physical activity). But the wide disparity in hormone use between supplement users and nonusers may indicate that the two groups of women were different in subtle yet important ways, Fisher says.\n\nHealth.com: Can supplements ease menopause symptoms?\n\n\"People choosing to take [hormone] replacement therapy often have underlying different characteristics and lifestyle behaviors, which you can't necessarily balance out with a mathematical model,\" she says.\n\nIt's not clear that the study results apply to the population of older women as a whole. The study participants were white and tended to live in rural areas, so the findings can't necessarily be generalized to other races and geographic areas.\n\nStill, the study is a reminder that supplements may not be as harmless as they seem, Fisher says. \"Taking more of what we think is a good thing may not be so good,\" she says. \"High levels of nutrient supplements may be harmful, or at least not helpful.\"\n\nCopyright Health Magazine 2011"}, {"annotators_ids": [15, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 21, 4, 19, 23], "scores": [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4], "summary": "Former Reading striker Jason Roberts believes promising coaches and managers are being lost to the game simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds.\nOnly 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are held by black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches, a new report has revealed.\nThe report was carried out by the Sports Person's Think Tank, which has called for English football to set an overall target of at least 20 per cent of coaches to be from BME backgrounds by 2020.", "text": "Former Reading striker Jason Roberts believes promising coaches and managers are being lost to the game simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nOnly 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are held by black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches, a new report has revealed.\n\nThe figures show that only 3.4 per cent of the coaches employed come from BME backgrounds despite making up 25 per cent of professional players.\n\nJason Roberts arrives for a meeting to discuss racism in football at 10 Downing Street in February 2012\n\nThe report was carried out by the Sports Person's Think Tank, which has called for English football to set an overall target of at least 20 per cent of coaches to be from BME backgrounds by 2020.\n\nRoberts, who is one of the founding members of the think tank, says in the report: 'It appears that football has lost successive generations of potential coaches and managers simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\n'The numbers do not add up, so many players from our communities who have achieved so much on the field of play -

Some accounts suggested a total of ten shots had been fired. Last night shocked friends insisted he had had no enemies.
